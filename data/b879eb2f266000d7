== GOAL

Early cancer detection

== DATA

"thousands" of cancer-positive and cancer-negative blood samples

== METHODS

Supervised learning

== RESULTS

Blood tests that could have insights for early cancer detection which leads to prevention

== ISSUES

No data on the diversity of samples or the amount of samples

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

A very good concept in theory but not much details were given on the specifics of the ML
methods or data. This could mean that they are very close to discovery and don't want to give away secrets,
or there is no headway being made.
