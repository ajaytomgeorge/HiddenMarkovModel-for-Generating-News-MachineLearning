From cartwheels to self driving cars, from Flyer 1903 to spaceX landing rockets, telephones to smart phones, humans have come a long way. But according to me there is no much change in the form of education delivered to students. Knowledge and education leads to more innovative ideas. The brain remembers images better compared to words because it is easier to understand that way. Words and images go side by side to understand a concept. And can also used for planning purpose.
