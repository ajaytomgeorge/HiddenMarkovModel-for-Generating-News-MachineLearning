==== AGENT

Who did the machine learning? 

Researchers from the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and the 
Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied and Sciences

==== GOAL

What were they trying to do?

Use machine learning to personalize the controls of soft exosuits and minimise the amount of 
energy a human uses during walking. 


==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?

They got their data from real time measurements of human physiological signals such as the
breathing rate.

==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

The researchers used a technique called “human-in-the-loop optimization.” This uses the real-time 
measurements of human physiological signal to adjust the control parameters. As the algorithm honed 
in on the best parameters, it directed the exosuit on when and where to deliver assistive force.


==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?

The researchers experimented by having 8 males to walk on a treadmill wearing soft exosuits 
for 20 minutes and then a computer developed a force profile for each walker. The exosuit and 
algorithm reduced metabolic cost by 17.4% compared to walking without the exosuit. 

==== COMMENTS

Your own personal comments and thoughts etc.

This is an incredible device as it is the beginning of actaul wearable exosuits as they are not 
bug chunky machines and they only provided assistance when it is needed as the computer is constantly
obeserving human physiological signals.
