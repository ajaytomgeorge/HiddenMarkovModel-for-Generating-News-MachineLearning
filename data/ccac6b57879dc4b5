Instance of false positives, where the algorithm thinks its a face but in actual fact it isn't. 
Algorithm also doesnt detect duplicates.

== COMMENTS

Really cool feature, very advnaced way of organising photos. If I was doing I'd first of all try solve the false positives and have it recognise duplicates.
The press release was very informative as it was apple that wrote it themselves.
