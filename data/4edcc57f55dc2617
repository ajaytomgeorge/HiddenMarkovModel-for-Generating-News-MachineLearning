== AGENT

Searidge

== GOAL

Increase landing capacity during low visibility conditions at Heathrow Airport

== DATA

18 4k cameras were set up on the airport and used to feed data into a collection for interpretation, along with data captured from 50000 aircraft movements

== METHODS

Supervised Deep Learning

== RESULTS

improvements in identifying approaching aircraft in low visibility conditions

== ISSUES

It will require a very large safety record before it can be implemented in the aviation sector before its implementation can expand

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

It is very promising while teething problems will exist and the cost of failure can be extreme, in the long run Machine learning traffic control would most likely perform better than a human can
