ARTICLE 1 - ALPHAFOLD
== SOURCE
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2

== AGENT
Google's Sister Company Deep mind

== GOAL
Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence

== DATA
The protein structure used for training were gotten from the Protein Data Bank

== METHODS
Supervised learning

== RESULTS
AlphaFold can predict highly accurate protein structures. It was entered into the CASP14 assessment, and it was vastly more accurate than its competitors.

== ISSUES
An issue I see is the neural network is owned by google and it is a company so it will work to make it profitable.

== SCORE
8

== COMMENTS
The project is very interesting. I had never heard of it before and its good to see a project that uses machine learning (deep learning) to solve a biotechnology problem.
