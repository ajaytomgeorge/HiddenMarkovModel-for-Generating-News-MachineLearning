Carbon Robotics
== GOAL
Its technology gives farmers a way to eliminate weeds without pesticides; to improve soil quality; to grow more organic produce; and to address both the ongoing labour shortage and increasing wages.
== DATA
Hi-res cameras feed imagery in real time to an onboard supercomputer that runs computer vision models to identify crops and weed.
== METHODS
There is no information available on the algorithms they used but I would speculate they used a supervised algorithm.
== RESULTS
They've successfully created a robot that can eliminate 100000 weeds per hour and can operate 24/7.
== ISSUES
I can't think of any ethical or technical issues with this project because it will decrease on pesticide use and help provide food for the growing population.
== SCORE
8
== COMMENTS
I found this project very interesting, I think more of this research is vital for the providing food for the growing population without the use of pesticides and other environmentally harmful chemicals.
