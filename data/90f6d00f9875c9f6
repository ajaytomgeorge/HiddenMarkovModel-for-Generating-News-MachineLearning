Massachusetts Institute of Technology

== GOAL

Identify synergistic drug blends for treating viruses like SARS-CoV-2.

== DATA

Molecules of disease

== METHODS

The model jointly learns drug-target interaction and drug-drug synergy to mine new combinations. The drug-target predictor models the interaction between a drug and a set of known biological targets that are related to the chosen disease. The target-disease association predictor learns to understand a drug's antiviral activity, which means determining the virus yield in infected tissue cultures. Together, they can predict the synergy of two drugs. 

== RESULTS

Two new drug combinations were found using this approach: remdesivir (currently approved by the FDA to treat Covid-19) and reserpine, as well as remdesivir and IQ-1S, which, in biological assays, proved powerful against the virus. 

== ISSUES

Cannot identify if virus will mutate and resist new drug combinations found.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Very good article about new approaches.
