== AGENT

Google Arts & Culture in partnership with Belvedere

== GOAL

To create an accurate coloured representation of the lost Klimt paintings from other artwork and using clues recorded in history, and black and white photographs of the paintings. 

== DATA

The machine learning system was trained on 80 of Klimt's other works to allow it to learn his usual colour schemes, moods etc.
It was also taught using 91749 artworks from Google Arts & Culture. 

== METHODS

In this project, the Pix2Pix algorithm is used, the core of which is a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network. This didn't work and was replaced. 
After, they usef used is novel model similar to DeOldify ("a U-net with a pre-trained ResNet-34 with self-attention, spectral normalization, and a 3-channel RGB input with color hints").

It was progressively trained with a custom feature loss, that used a pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network critic.

The black & white images had small touches of colour added at the beginning based on what was known from research and then fed to the AI for it to use as a starting point.

== RESULTS

This method resulted in the re-coloured images of the three lost paintings. It is impossible to tell exactly how close the end results are but thee are some of the best approximations anyone has.

== ISSUES

These are hard to verify, as the original paintings are lost and unrecoverable. At best, we can hope for a close interpretation of the images.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

The press cover of this didn't include many details about the actual proces involved. They talked about the decision-making process but not much about the technology itself. 

I particularly like this example of machine learning in use because it combines machine learning with a humna touch, and shows that much more can be accomplished by combining the strengths of people and the strengths of computers.
