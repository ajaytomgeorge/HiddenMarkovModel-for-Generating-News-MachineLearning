Unsupervised learning/Deep learning.

== RESULTS

The AI beat the worlds best Go player.

== ISSUES

Creates a situation in which we put ourselves in direct competition with machines.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I thought this was interesting as the article states that Go is one of the world's most complex games and is very
difficult for a computer to learn compared to other games such as chess and thus this demonstrates the power of
machines at solving complex tasks.
The report is fair as it shares insights from leading experts and the information present is generally correct.
