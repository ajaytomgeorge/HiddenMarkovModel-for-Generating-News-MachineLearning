== GOAL

Utilise a face-recognition system which matches the face of a criminal from a video to a photographic 
identification in order to find a suspect.

== DATA

Grainy CCTV footage matched against database of photographic identification

== METHODS

Deep Learning

== RESULTS

Wrongful accusation.

== ISSUES

Facial recognition has been found to be far less effective at identifying darker skinned people.
Sub-par images also contributed to misidentification.

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

I thought it was interesting the fact that this technology has trouble identifying darker skinned subjects.
The report was reasonable as there is found to be an error rate difference of up to 34.4% between identifying light skinned and dark skinned people with 
facial-recognition technology.
Facial-recognition technology is relatively new in the sense that it has only become widely available in the past 5-or-so years and it is still far from
perfect as seen in this article.
