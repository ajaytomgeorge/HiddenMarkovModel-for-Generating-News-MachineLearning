==== AGENT

Chatbot by Babylon Health

==== GOAL

To reduce the risk of a patient being misdiagnosed due to lack of information or otherwise

==== DATA

The chatbot gets its data from a database of diseases available to it and matches the users symptoms. 

==== METHODS

The chatbot compares the symptoms that the users input via speech and then the chat bot checks the symptoms against the diseases database that it has. Depending on the condition that the chatbot responds with it also responds with a course of action.

==== RESULTS

Due to the chatbot in a hospital that it was being tested in saw a decrease in the amount of patients. 10% of the users in the trial registered for the app.

==== COMMENTS

In my opinion it is a good app as many people would check there symptoms first and see what they should do instead of heading to the hospital. This reduces the wait times in hospitals and allows the people that need to see the doctors to see them faster.
