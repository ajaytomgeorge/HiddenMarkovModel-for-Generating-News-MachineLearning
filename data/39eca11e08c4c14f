==== AGENT

The two universities involved in this project were MIT and the University of California at San Diego (UCSD).The authors and researchers for this paper were the 
following: 
Testart and David Clark, an MIT senior research scientist, alongside MIT postdoc Philipp Richter 
and data scientist Alistair King as well as research scientist Alberto Dainotti of UCSD.

==== GOAL

Use machine learning to hunt down cybercriminals

==== DATA

The data used was gotten from the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA).
The data came inn the form of IP addresses.

==== METHODS
The Machine Learning system was used to flag networks that displayed certain charactheristics that are identifiers of cybercriminals, 
the following charactheristics were used as the identifiers:
	
	-Volatile changes in activity: Hijackers’ address blocks seem to disappear much faster than those of legitimate networks. 
	 The average duration of a flagged network’s prefix was under 50 days, compared to almost two years for legitimate networks.
	-Multiple address blocks: Serial hijackers tend to advertise many more blocks of IP addresses, also known as “network prefixes.”
	-IP addresses in multiple countries: Most networks don’t have foreign IP addresses. In contrast, for the networks that serial 
	 hijackers advertised that they had, they were much more likely to be registered in different countries and continents.

==== RESULTS

The project was successful as they had proven that by using several years worth of data network mailing lists along with historical BGP data
it was possible to observe particular qualities of malicious cyber activity, which was then used to train a machine learning model to automatically
identify such behaviours.

==== COMMENTS

This project is definitely a great use of machine learning to fight a ever-growing problem in todays world. From what the researchers from this project 
have said about the current low level of security to identify cyber attacks, it would be in everyones best interest that this machine elarning model 
be developed further and implemented as a security detection against malicious cyber behaviour.
