Imperial College London

== GOAL

To predict hospital-onset COVID-19 infections using dynamic networks of patient contacts

== DATA

Contact networks from hospital data collected routinely together with clinical attributes 
and background contextual hospital data of the patient.

== METHODS

They trained the framework on 50,000 patients admitted to a NHS Trust hospital and validated it 
on 40,057 inpatients from a hospital site in Geneva as well as 43,375 inpatients from the same
NHS Trust but from a different time period. It seems that it was a supervised learning method where
the framework had to predict a positive or negative test given information about the patient and who
they were in contact with as well as if they had contracted covid soon after. 

== RESULTS

The framework achieved high predictive performance on the training and validation sets. The results
suggest that contact networks could be a predictor of viral spred

== ISSUES

None that were evident in the article 

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

While the purpose of the study was to more or less show that a patient's contact network could be a good
indicator of infection, the lack of representative data really prevents it from being of any real use. Also,
using ML to predict viral infection seems forced. We already know that being in contact with those who are 
infected will more likely cause us to be infected as well. Also it is a fact that being in large groups of 
people during a viral pandemic will statistically raise chances of being infected. Why do we need ML in this area?
