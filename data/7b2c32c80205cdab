== GOAL

Improvement to feature selection for less noisy datasets using ML.

== DATA



== METHODS

Implemented a hybrid binary version of a chaotic crow search and particle
swarm optimisation algorithm. With k-Nearest Neighbour as a classifier, six
different performance metrics were used. With opposition-based learning
technique in the local search of the algorithm.

== RESULTS

An average accuracy of 89.67% over 15 datasets which is better than the
current standard.

== ISSUES

Only 15 datasets have been tested.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Very cool usage of machine learning to improve machine learning activities,
could see great potential.
