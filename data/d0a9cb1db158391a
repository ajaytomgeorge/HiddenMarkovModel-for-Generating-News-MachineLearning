==== AGENT

Ben Klingensmith an undergraduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in Behavioral Economics, Policy, and Organizations and Statistics and Machine Learning has been working on this project under the mentorship of Jay Aronson, director of Carnegie Mellon’s Center for Human Rights Science and Robin Mejia, the center’s statistics manager.


==== GOAL

The goal was to process this raw data and use the information to understand conditions in the state’s 62 county jails and inform state public policy, creating a report that classifies and explores the types of deaths occurring in the jail system. 


==== DATA

They started with a spreadsheet of raw data from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.


==== METHODS

Ben was self-motivated and had really good data instincts.The most the painstaking process of the project was making sense of the data. His first pass on the dataset was impressive, especially as he explored how to best address the Prison Society’s questions, even working to answer questions they didn’t know they could ask. Preparation and initiative were instrumental in getting the project off to a good start. Moreover, Klingensmith's mentor, Mejia’s mentorship helped him grow his interactions with the Prison Society to work more independently toward their specific goals.


==== RESULTS

Ultimately, Klingensmith’s data analysis will be used to advance the Prison Society’s mission of advocating for humane conditions in Pennsylvania’s prisons and jails.

“Thanks to Ben’s research, for the first time ever, we will publish a report that can empirically compare jail conditions in Pennsylvania,” Prison Society Executive Director Shubik-Richards said. “With very limited resources, we don’t have the ability at the Prison Society to do this analysis on our own. This partnership with Carnegie Mellon allows us to do what really needs to be done and at a level of academic rigor and excellence that is hard to beat.”


==== COMMENTS

The choice of the domain is quite interesting and the results achieved are also commendable but what i believe is that the article would have been even more reproducible if there had been more information on how the data was processed to generate insights from the raw data.
