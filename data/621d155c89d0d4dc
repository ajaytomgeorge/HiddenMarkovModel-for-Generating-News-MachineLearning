==== AGENT

A group of researchers from Google's artificial-intelligence subsidiary, DeepMind.

==== GOAL

Google's Deepmind goal was to build a single system that could teach itself 
from scratch how to master the games of chess, shogi and Go. Traditional 
chess engines such as Stockfish and IBM's Deep Blue relied on thousands of
rules and different strategies formed by expert chess players that try to 
account for every eventually in a game. 
The program created by DeepMind, AlphaZero quickly learns each game by playing 
against itself millions of times starting its training from random play with no 
bulit-in knowledge but the basic rules of the game.
 
==== DATA

The data was self generated as AlphaZero learnt from itself. However, the head-to-head
performance of AlphaZero was tested against starting human openings positions
(200 games as black and 200 games as white from each opening) as these opening positions 
were played over 100,000 times in the online database. Database can be found on 
www.https://www.365chess.com/

==== METHODS

AlphaZero uses a neural network that plays millions of games against itself and learns 
through reinforcement learning. At the start it plays completely randomly, but learns 
over time from wins, loses and draws to adjust the parameters in the neural network. 
The trained neural network is used to guide a search algorithm (Monte-Carlo Tree Search)
to select the favourable moves in the game.

==== RESULTS

The results from AlphaZero were promising, the Neural Network guided the MCTS to the
most promising positions, it searches only 60 thousand positions per second, compared to
60 million in other search chess engines.
To test the robustness of AlphaZero, it played Stockfish 1000 times, winning 155 games
and losing just 6 games.

==== COMMENTS

After just two hours of learning, AlphaZero was performing better than human players
and after four, it was beating the best chess engines in the world. AlphaZero can 
think at a far higher rate than humans and it may change how the game of chess is 
played in future.
