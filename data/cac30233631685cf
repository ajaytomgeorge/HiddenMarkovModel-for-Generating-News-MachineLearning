==== AGENT

The developers for this project were researchers at MIT, in collaboration with an IT company called Cognizant.

==== GOAL

Their aim was to develop a machine learning algorithm that will identify the growing conditions that would optimise the compounds responsible for basil's flavour;
hence enhancing its taste.

==== DATA

The dataset was formed from the compounds that they found affect the flavour of basil.

==== METHODS

The researchers used gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to look for certain compounds that affect the taste of basil.
The results from this research were then fed into the algorithm.
From this, the algorithm determines the best temperature, light, humidity, and other environmental factors to use.

==== RESULTS

They found that exposing plants to light 24 hours a day result in the best taste.
They also plan to further develop this technology and use it to improve the disease-fighting capabilities of plants and for climate change research.

==== COMMENTS

I think that the project itself is an unexpected but beneficial use of machine learning.
The article could be more detailed in terms of explaining the algorithm itself, as well as providing more insight to the outcome of the development.
