== GOAL

Find powerful peptides that could improve a gene therapy drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
In layman's terms, Use Machine learning to discover new sequences to boost drug delivery.
Another goal of the study was to One goal of the project was to create a model that could work with any amino acid,
while only 20 amino acids naturally occur in the human body, hundreds more exist elsewhere.

== DATA

Before a model could make any worthwhile predictions, researchers on the experimental side needed to create a robust dataset. 
By mixing and matching 57 different peptides, Schissel and her colleagues were able to build a library of 600 miniproteins, each attached to PMO. 
The team was able to quantify how well each miniprotein could move its cargo across the cell.

== METHODS

The team trained a convolutional neural network on the miniprotein library, 
with each of the 600 miniproteins labeled with its activity, indicating its ability to permeate the cell.

== RESULTS

The machine learning model proposed sequences that were more effective than any previously known variant. One in particular can boost PMO delivery by 50-fold.
By injecting mice with these computer-suggested sequences, the researchers validated their predictions and demonstrated that the miniproteins are nontoxic.

== ISSUES

I found the study very interesting In how a computer science technique like machine learning can boost the performance in delivery of medicine by a significant amount.
It really shows the potential of this area in CS. The only issue I had with this study was their use of mice as guinea pigs not knowing
whether a substance is toxic to humans. It might be best practice in the industry but it still seems wrong to do this.

== COMMENTS

I thought the study was inspiring and a real advancement in the area of medicine.
An area of potential from reading all of these machine learning articles and studys,
would be to further mesh machine learning and medicine/ healthcare together.
