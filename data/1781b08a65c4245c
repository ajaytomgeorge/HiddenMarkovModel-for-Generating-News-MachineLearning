== GOAL

Efficient and targeted COVID-19 vorder teseting via reinforcement learning. Limit the influx of asymptomatic 
travellers infected with SARS-COV-2.
Adapt border policies based on real-time estimates of covid-19 prevalence.

== DATA

They acquired demographic data (country, region, age, gender, point and date of entry from travellers 24 hours prior to travelling 
and used this to train the so-called 'EVA' model.


== METHODS

Reinforcement learning was the main method used. Lasso regression was used to adaptively extract demographic 
features of passengers. Bayes' method used to estimate each traveller type's prevalence daily.

== RESULTS

Eva was most effective when testing was more scarce. Random surveillence testing would have identified 54.1% of cases
Eva identified (+-8%).

== ISSUES

I think a more accurate region description was neccessary when describing the country of origin, to allow for
higher accuracy when predicting covid prevalence. This would have better accounted for those living in densely-populated 
areas and those who lived in more sparsely-populated regions in a given country.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Your comments on this: did you think it was interesting and why, would
you have done it differently, was the reporting in the Press
reasonable or did they get lots of stuff wrong, etc. Was the method new,
or was it interesting new data, or an interesting new way of using existing
data and methods?


The methods were quite conventional and modern, but used on interesting data with an extremely useful application. I 
may have used a deep learning model for the regression problem in which they used lasso regression, although, being unfirmiliar with
the data first-hand, I assume lasso fit the dataset most optimally.
