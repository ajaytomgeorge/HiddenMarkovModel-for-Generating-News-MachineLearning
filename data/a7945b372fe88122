==== AGENT

Facebook AI Lab

==== GOAL

Creating an AI bot to monitor posts and remove offensive or misinformed content from the platform.

==== DATA

Posts previously removed by humans.

==== METHODS

The tool began by analyzing Facebook posts that mentioned the Islamic State or Al Qaeda and flagged those that most likely violated the companyâ€™s counterterrorism policies. Human curators then reviewed the posts.
They then extended the tool to also include other unwanted content, such as nudity or fake accounts.

==== RESULTS

The system was very successful in distiguishing unwanted images from acceptable ones, such as being able to point out marijuana buds from broccoli heads. However, it is still learning and will probably forever do so as people try to find ways around it.
