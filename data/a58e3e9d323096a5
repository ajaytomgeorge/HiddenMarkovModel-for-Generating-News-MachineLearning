or several notes based on a style of a given performer.

Cope used a reinforced learning algorithm to develope music based on input music predicting the next set of 
notes.

==== RESULTS

Emily Howells youtube channel currently has 11 seperate music pieces online and 1.49K subscribers with one music 
piece currently sitting at 30K views as of Oct. 2019 

==== COMMENTS

Some of the music pieces are actually quite good and would easily pass off as a human composer.
It leads me to think that there could be a lot more predictability in music than I once thought.
A future in music is increasingly under threat.
