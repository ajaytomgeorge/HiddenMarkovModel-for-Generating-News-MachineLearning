==== GOAL

The goal of the project was to develop an automatic approach which would be able to create realistic
colorisation's of old black and white photos and also black and white movies. 

==== DATA

The data used was a set of 1.5 million colour photos of images ranging from landscape, to people and animals.

==== METHODS

The team approached the problem by posing it as a classification problem using class-rebalancing at
training time. The machine learning method that the team used was a feed-forward pass in a convolutional 
neural network that was trained using over 1 million colour images. The method that the team used to train
the machine learning algorithm was to decompose millions of colour images. These images were decompose into 
two separate parts, the black and white component and the colour component. After the model had been successful
trained a black and white image could then by fed into the model which would generate a coloured version of the 
image.
 
==== RESULTS

The team successfully managed to build the model that could apply realistic colour to old black and white 
photos and movies.

==== COMMENTS

I think that this project shows how machine learning can be applied to many areas of industries where one 
would not immediately think that computer science would be applicable.

==== AGENT

Remi.ai is a machine learning AI startup located in Sydney Australia.

==== GOAL

The goal was to use machine learning to help a customer to understand grape health, size and count. The customer
owned a vineyard for the production of wine and the machine learning model was going to help accurately forecast
harvest yields.

==== DATA

The data used was photos of bunches of grapes that were of various ages and also grapes that had certain types 
of diseases and damage to them.

==== METHODS

The system was a deep learning algorithm and datasets that was used to automatically monitor the grapes of the 
vineyard over the one thousand hectares. The system had the ability to identify the size of the grapes too an 
accuracy of 0.3 millimetres and the system was also able to estimate the numbers of grape in each bunch.
 
==== RESULTS

A pilot of the system was rolled out to the vineyards in the Hunter Valley wine region in New South Wales Australia.


==== COMMENTS

This system is a great example of how AI can be successfully applied to agri foods sector, where monotonous tasks can 
be handed over to machines and productivity and wast can be controlled more effectively.

eHarmony is an online dating site.

==== GOAL

The goal of eHarmony is to use the personal information that clients provide and to use machine learning algorithms 
to find a romantic match from the client.

==== DATA

29 different dimensions of personality are collected from each user of the website in the form of a questionnaire.
There are 436 questions in the questionnaire and about 15,000 different people take the questionnaire each day.

==== METHODS

eHarmony uses integer optimisation in its matching algorithm. The algorithm works by assigning a compatibility 
score to pairs of people on the website, ranging between 1 and 5. Each person should match to one other person 
using the mathematical constraint x1 + x2 + x3 = 1. Logistic regression is then used on pairs of users differences
to predict compatibility. In order to reduce the size of the data only people from the surrounding area are considered
who have compatibility scores listed in the data set. Next the absolute difference is computed on the features for the 
1475 pairs. Then a logistic regression model is trained on the differences. A low threshold for the logistic model is 
used which generates a high proportion of false positives but also gets a high proportion of true positives. The classification
matrix for a threshold equal to 0.2 generates a successful matching rate of 29%, which is very high for an online dating sit.
 
==== RESULTS

Since 2000 eHarmony has generated over $1 billion dollars in revenue and in 2012 nearly 4% of US marriages were as a result of
eHarmony. 


==== COMMENTS

The online dating site eHarmony has created an enormously profitable business using quite a simple and straight forward type of
machine learning, Linear Regression.

Nate Silver, columnist with the New York Times.

==== GOAL

To use polling data to predict state winners in the 2012 US Presidential Election. Also to predict which candidate would win
the vote in each state.

==== DATA

The data used was polling data which was collected in the months leading up to the 2012 Presidential Election. The data included state, year, Boolean variable for Republican or Democrat.

==== METHODS

A mathematical model of how people would vote on a particular day was constructed, this was called the 
nowcast, ie how people would vote if they had to today. There were numerous variables that would affect
How a person would vote, so these vote were taken into account in the model, such as what area a person 
came from, also what race a person is.
This model is used as a baseline of voting from that point in time. The model takes into account changes 
that happen, both regional and state wise, and these are fed into the model. For example if unemployment
in an area went down the incumbent party will gain popularity in that area. All of these variable were then
used with a logistic regression model and this is what was used to make the prediction for the Presidential
Election.

 
==== RESULTS

Nate Silver was one of the few main stream commentators who successfully predicted the outcome of the 2012
Presidential Election.

==== COMMENTS

Again a pretty standard regression model can be used with great affect to make predictions that no one else
can see.

IBM Watson Oncology.

==== GOAL

The goal is to use data and machine learning to make medication and medical treatments more personalised and not just to 
rely on generic treatments that the health services are currently offering.

==== DATA

The data used in personalised medical treatment are the patients genetic information, their family history and their medical 
history.

==== METHODS

Personalised medical treatment uses deep learning which is a specialised machine learning approach based on the multiple-
layered structures of artificial neurons. These neurons are able to process information and learn by adjusting the weights
at each neuron allowing for an accurate prediction to be made. These deep networks are capable of learning from large amounts
of data and are then able to apply this learning to new unseen data. Deep learning systems are able to integrate data from an
individual patient and allow better predictions and recommendations for treatment options to patients based on individual 
characteristics.

 
==== RESULTS

Deep learning systems are very well suited for the large amounts of healthcare data and out perform the more traditional 
statistical models that had previously existed.


==== COMMENTS

The area of health care personalisation is a fine challenge for todays deep learning systems.
