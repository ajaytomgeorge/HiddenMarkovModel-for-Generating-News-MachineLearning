== GOAL
Stop the Roomba vacuum from smearing dog poop all over your house
== DATA
iRobot spent years building a library of pictures of poop, real and faux. First purchasing all the realistic gag poop available online and then making and photographing play-doh models, as well as this all iRobot employees with pets took multiple photos of their animal's waste from many angles.
== METHODS
A supervised learning algorithm was used in order to train the image recognition software
== RESULTS
The company is now confident enough in the vacuum's ability to avoid pet waste that it will replace any j7+ vacuums that come into contact with pet waste.
== ISSUES
I can't think of any ethical or technical issues with this project.
== SCORE
7
== COMMENTS
The company has effectively used AI to overcome a flaw in their product.
