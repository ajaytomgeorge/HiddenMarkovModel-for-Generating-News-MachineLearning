International Conference on Computational Creativity

== GOAL

Use machine learning to generate funny versions of headlines.

== DATA

The data set used in this model was the Humicroedit dataset.
A data set containing over 15,000 annotated news headlines

== METHODS

The model was fed words that could be funny substitutes for some of the words featured in each title. 
It would first parse the headline. The the model would retrive candidate replacements.
Then it could evalute the candidates based on things such as semantic similiarty and the releation to the target headline.
Finally the headlines were shown to a select group of researhers to determine if the headlines were funny. 

== RESULTS

Overall, the researchers found that the humorous headlines produced by their model were comparable to those generated by humans on several levels

== ISSUES

The major issue in this was to see if it would be possible if an AI could generate something that a human could interperate as funny. 

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I find the idea of computational creativity extremly interesting and exciting. I belive that there is a lot more work to do in this area.
