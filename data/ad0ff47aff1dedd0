==== GOAL

They were trying to develop neural network that 
adaptively propagates the sentiments of
words to target depending on the context
and syntactic relationships between them

==== DATA

Posts from Twitter
"For the tweets, our task is to classify their sentiments for a given target as positive, negative, and
neutral. People may mention several entities (or
targets) in one tweet, which affects the availabilities for most of existing methods. For example,
the tweet “@ballmer: windows phone is better
than ios!” has three targets (@ballmer, windows
phone, and ios). "

==== METHODS

"We use the dependency parsing results to find the
words syntactically connected with the interested
target. Adaptive Recursive Neural Network is proposed to propagate the sentiments of words to the
target node. We model the adaptive sentiment
propagations as semantic compositions. The computation process is conducted in a bottom-up manner, and the vector representations are computed
recursively. After we obtain the representation of
target node, a classifier is used to predict the sentiment label according to the vector"

==== RESULTS

"We propose Adaptive Recursive Neural Network
(AdaRNN) for the target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification. AdaRNN employs more than
one composition functions and adaptively chooses
them depending on the context and linguistic tags.
For a given tweet, we first convert its dependency
tree for the interested target. Next, the AdaRNN
learns how to adaptively propagate the sentiments
of words to the target node. AdaRNN enables
the sentiment propagations to be sensitive to both
linguistic and semantic categories by using different compositions. The experimental results illustrate that AdaRNN improves the baselines without
hand-crafted rules."


==== COMMENTS

Honeslty, for me it sounds useless. Such complicated thing for classification 
for tweets of random human beings? The only reason for this is to know an opinion of majority, 
on specific question but there are better ways of doing this for companies and it's useless for individuals (imho)
