==== AGENT

Molecule.one

==== GOAL

Use machine learning to automatically discover formulas for completex molecules and 
chemicals for pharmacutical purposes.

==== DATA

The databases utilised in this project was pulled mostly from the US patent office which 
stores tons of patents revolving around chemical processes.

==== METHODS

Molecule.one runs simulations of biological and chemical interactions in order to 
determine the compound best suited to fight a particular disease. This function already 
existed in many other softwares however, the new function Molecule.one brings to the 
table is its ability to search its database of chemical processes and determine also
how to synthesize these new chemicals. This is a processess which was previously done
manually and was time consuming. It also contains a database of commercially available
chemicals and their pricing and can hence calculate the cheapest way to synthesize
a chemical while also minimising the number of toxic reagents used.

==== RESULTS

The results for this software were very positive, it reduces the amount of time required 
to discover and synthesize new drugs for market and medical practices.

==== COMMENTS

I believe this software, if applied properly, could revolutionise the medical and 
pharmacutical industries.
However if the technology is not developed and fully utilized then it may just fade into 
the background and never reach it's full potential.
