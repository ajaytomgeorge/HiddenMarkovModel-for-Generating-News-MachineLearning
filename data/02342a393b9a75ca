== GOAL

To monitor the brain activity of patients receiving general anesthesia.

== DATA

They have used 60,000 patients data to conduct this study

== METHODS

Bayesian state-space algorithm 

== RESULTS

There are two important terms to be considered. One is peak-max pattern and the other one is trough-max pattern. Findings suggest that the peak-max pattern is a marker of profound unconsciousness, and the transition from the peak-max pattern to the trough-max pattern predicts when subjects may be able to recover consciousness. 

== ISSUES

NIL

== SCORE 

8

== COMMENTS

It is a interestig project as we could keep track of patients consciousness during treatment
