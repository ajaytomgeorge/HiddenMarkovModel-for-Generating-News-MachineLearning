University of California - Irvine

==== GOAL

Machine learning used to help tell which wildfires will burn out of control

==== DATA

climate data and crucial details about atmospheric conditions and the types of vegetation present around the starting point of a fire

==== METHODS

"decision tree" algorithm. The algorithm "learns" with each new data point and can quickly figure out the critical thresholds for identifying large fire

==== RESULTS

The researchers could predict the final size of a blaze 50 percent of the time

==== COMMENTS

This could be a very important use of machine learning and in the future help save wildlife and people lives if a fire is caught in time.
