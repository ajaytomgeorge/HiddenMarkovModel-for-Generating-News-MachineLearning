== AGENT

Researchers at the National University of Singapore.

== GOAL

Use machine learning to correctly test for cancerous cells.

== DATA

The images used for the research were taken by the researchers. Using cell samples, they stained and imaged the samples to build up their own dataset.

The data was split using a 10-fold-cross-validation for model testing.

== METHODS

A pH-sensitive dye is applied to the single cells, which are then put through "Otsu's binaraization", an unsupervised binarization based on the ratio of RGB colours, using K-means clustering.

== RESULTS

These cancer tests can be completed in under 35 minutes, with single cells able to be classified with an accuracy over 95%.

== ISSUES

The researchers have their data available upon request but do not have any public code so recreating the study would be difficult.

== SCORE

10

== COMMENTS

Personally I think the press could have included more information on the machine learning aspect of this research. They descri`bed the process of testing the cells, and skipped over the machine learning element. 
They mention 'the AI' they use but treat it like a black box with no details on the method, training, testing, or data sets.
The novel attempt to solve a massive issue in the health industry is very promising.
