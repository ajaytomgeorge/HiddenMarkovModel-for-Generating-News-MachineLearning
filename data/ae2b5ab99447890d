==== AGENT

Who did the machine learning? 

Netflix engineers

==== GOAL

What were they trying to do?

Netflix were aiming to use machine learning for the pupose of personalization of movie 
recommendations, auto-generation and personalization of thumbnails / artwork,
location scouting for movie production, movie editing and streaming quality.

==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?

Netflix retrieved their data from the analysis of the behavior of its users. 
They put together a 360 profile of each user which contains thousands of attributes.
This is used to group people with similar interests and use data from one user to
predict the behaviour of another.

==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

Netflix uses the watching history of other users with the same interests to suggest
what you may be interested in to keep users constantly engaged. They also conducted 
research into how much an attractive thumbnail influences a user by observing a sample 
of users in 2014. 


==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?

They discovered that artwork was the biggest influencer for a userâ€™s decision about 
what to watch, and it also was primarily 82 percent of their focus while browsing Netflix.
It was also discovered that a user spent 1.8 seconds on average considering a movie and they 
were surprised at how little time they had to capture a users attention.

==== COMMENTS

Your own personal comments and thoughts etc.

Netflix cleverly uses machine learning when it comes to tailoring an experience 
towards each user which gives it the edge over its opposition which just suggests 
popular movies at that point in time. The facts of how quickly a person spends on deciding on what
tile to watch was very intriguing and demonstrates the importance of machine learning for Netflix.
