== AGENT

Optum of Eden Prairie

== GOAL

To help US hospitals allocate health care to patients.

== DATA

The data they received was from a large hospital.  The specific data was not mentioned but contained
sensitive medical history and records of patiants.

== METHODS

The system would of been a supervised logistic regression model.

== RESULTS

Black people had to be sicker than white people before being referred for additional help.
Only 17% of patients that the algorithm assigned to receive extra care were black.
The researchers calculate that the proportion would be 46.5% if the algorithm were unbiased.

== ISSUES

There was a bias in the model which resulted in black people being allocated less help than
white people.  The researchers found that the algorithm assigned risk scores to patients on
the basis of total health-care costs accrued in one year and say that this assumption might
have seemed reasonable because higher health-care costs are generally associated with greater
health needs.  This seemed to be the case as the average black person was also substantially
sicker than the average white person, with a greater prevalence of conditions such as diabetes,
anaemia, kidney failure and high blood pressure.

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

It artical was somewhat interesting as it did shed some light on the fact that dias models can
be improved by at least 84% which is a large amount.  Though the artchal did not specifically go
into much detail about the technology such a specific data.  The press did a mediocar job, as I thought
they only really suplied superficial information.  But what they did mention they didnt get wrong.
