==== AGENT

Reasearchers at MIT and the University of California in San Diego
==== GOAL

Using Machine Learning to hunt down Cybercriminals
==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?

Got several years worth of network operators mailing list as well BGP data taken ever y5mns from the global routing table.

==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

Hijacking IP addresses is an increasingly popular form of cyber-attack. This can be sending spam,malware to steal information.They were trying to predict
the incidents in advance by tracing back to the hijackers using machine learning.They used data from several network operators mailing list to observe fotr malicious
activities and use a model to train this to automatically identify these activites.They flag the network that several characteristics. which are changes in networks frequenlty
a legitmate network's address blaock stay for a lot longer while hijackers bloack stay less than 50 days.

==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?
They are still working on increasing the security measures. Introducing cryptography to ensure that the network announces legitmate IP address.

==== COMMENTS

This is very crucial project as many people rely on internet for crucial bank transcations. This can be easily misused by these hijackers. This project can provide
better solotions to prevent activities such as anti-spoofing, filtering etc.
