==== AGENT

A researcher named Anthony Dm.


==== GOAL

Anthony wondered what would happen if I grabbed a bunch of unlabeled emails, put them all together in one black box and let a machine figure out what to do with them.


==== DATA

After looking into several datasets, came up with the Enron corpus. This dataset has over 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation, plenty enough if you ask me.


==== METHODS

For clustering the unlabeled emails he used unsupervised machine learning as he had training data with 
only inputs, also known as features and contains no outcomes. Rather than using +500k emails, he chunked
the dataset into a couple of files with each 10k emails. He now had 10k emails in the dataset separated
into 3 columns (index, message_id and the raw message). Before working with this data He parsed the raw 
message into key-value pairs. Eventually, he analyzed the text with term frequency–inverse document 
frequency(TF-IDF) and further converted the email bodies into a document-term matrix. Finally, after finding
out the top keywords, he applied k-means algorthm to identify the 3 clusters and wrote a function that extracts 
the top terms per cluster. After observing some wierd terms like ‘hou’ and ‘ect’, he added some custom stopwords 
to the tfidf vectorizer and observed that the first cluster contains no exciting terms, the second cluster consist
almost alone out of Person names but the last cluster was of great interest.

==== RESULTS

After inspecting those clusters and finding some interesting insights, He used a more supervised approach
to group emails related to a particular keyword.   

==== COMMENTS

Anthony had a unique perspective and he chose to take a non-traditional path of text analysis. His approach of 
visualizing the top terms using a plot and then selecting the course-of-action is quite fascinating.
