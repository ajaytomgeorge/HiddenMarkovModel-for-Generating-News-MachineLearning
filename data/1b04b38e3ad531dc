==== AGENT

University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Funded by Facebook

==== GOAL

The goal of the project was to use a machine learning algorithm to determine 
what question a subject had been asked based on brain activity monitored by electrodes in 
the subjects brain

==== DATA

They used electrodes which were temporarily implanted in subjects brains while they were
awaiting surgery for epilepsy. These electrodes provided data of the subjects brain activity
as they were asked to answer a set of preset questions.

==== METHODS

The brain activity was fed into a nueral network which would try to denote which question had been asked.
This was done using a supervised training algorithm/

==== RESULTS

The AI managed to predict the correct question with 76% accuracy

==== COMMENTS

If it wasn't funded by Facebook I'd probably look the other way but can we talk about how
Facebook is funding mind reading research? That's fucking terrifying

Allen Institute for Cell Science in Seattle

==== GOAL

They wanted to develop a method to identify a living cell’s components in images taken using brightfield microscopy

==== DATA

A large collection of images of cells taken with both brightfeil microscopy and florecent microscopy

==== METHODS

They fed these pictures through a deep learning algorithm.

==== RESULTS

The Nueral Network was able to build a 3d model the cells given from a collection of brightfield images of the cell.

==== COMMENTS

This could be very useful for microbiology. It could avoid damaging cells while trying to examine them.

Jennifer Hoyal Cuthill's group with joint positions at 
the University of Cambridge, University of Essex, and Tokyo Institute of Technology

==== GOAL

The scientists set out to test a model known as Müllerian mimicry, 
which proposes that species sometimes mimic each other to glean mutual benefits; 
for instance, a predator might mistake an edible butterfly for a toxic one if the insects look similar, 
which softens the effect of predation on both species.

==== DATA

They trained the system on 2,400 photographs of Heliconius butterflies

==== METHODS

They used a predictive AI to isolate how butterflies in coevolution share features by feeding it pictures of butterflies 
and finding related features.

==== RESULTS

They managed to show how butterflies both evolve thier own features as well as copying features from other species 
and forming their own features from them.

==== COMMENTS

This is a pretty cool example of how machine learning can be used in the world of biology.

==== AGENT

The Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) at Johns Hopkins University

==== GOAL

The goal of the project was to use a nueral network to detect the toxicity of a chemical based on its structure

==== DATA

The data used was at first over 800,000 toxicological studies on over 10,000 chemical structures. It was
later expanded to have over 10,000,000 chemical structures.

==== METHODS

Using big data, they fed all of the information through a transfer learning method of machine learning. This is a method
where the algorithm applies information from one task or item set to another.

==== RESULTS

The results of the experiment had the machine learning algorithm predicting the toxicity of the chemical give
correctly 87% of the time, this is far better than the 70% achieved with animal testing. It cannot however 
detect whether a chemical may cause cancer or may affect an embryo as the biological precesses involved are too complex.

==== COMMENTS

This is pretty great as an example of ways the power of machine learning can be used to improve the state of the world,
this is great but, and i stress, FACEBOOK MIND READING IS A BAD THING.
