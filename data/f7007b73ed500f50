== AGENT

A team at Stanford University and the California Polytechnic State University

== GOAL

A deep learning approach to classifying buildings with wildfire damage to help responders focus their recovery efforts 
and offer more immediate information to displaced residents.

== DATA

They used pre-fire photos and post-wildfire images.

== METHODS

DamageMap first uses pre-fire photos of any type to map the area and pinpoint building locations. 
Then, the program analyzes post-wildfire images to identify damage through features like blackened surfaces, crumbled roofs or the absence of structures.
They used supervised learning.

== RESULTS

The researchers tested it using a variety of satellite, aerial and drone photography with at least 92 percent accuracy.

== ISSUES

I dont see many issues with the work other than it might missinterpret some building features if they have slighlty different features to what they are expecting.
For example if a house already had a black slated roof would it think that it has been blackened form a wildfire? Other than this I really like it. 

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

I think this project was very interesting as I think it will really help first responders go to the properties that have been damaged the most, 
and could really save a lot og peoples homes. I really like the idea that they are simply comparing satellite images of before and after the wildfire,
and only loooking for specific features like blackened surfaces to identify if a property has been effected or not. The article was very informative 
and was written very well.
