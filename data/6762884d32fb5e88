==== AGENT
Neuroscientist Carlos Ponce of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

==== DATA
The data used was in the form of images generated by a generative adversal network, the monkies were shown 40 images
that would try and stimulate their neurons.

==== GOAL
OPtimizing images for stimulating monkey neurons, enabling deep machine learning systems to generate new images
that ramp up cell's excitation.

==== METHODS
The monkeys were shwon 40 images, the 10 most effective were then taken and used as input to a GAN and 30 more produced.
The original 10 and the following 30 then shown again, this process was repeated 250 times. 

==== RESULTS
The network made new images that, based on its own mathematical functions, were predicted to boost the activity 
of corresponding neurons in the animalâ€™s brain.
