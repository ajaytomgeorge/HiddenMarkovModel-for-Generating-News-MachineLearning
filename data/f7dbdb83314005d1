== AGENT

The US Department of Energyâ€™s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL).

== GOAL

Predict any disruptions that halt fusion reactions and damage doughnut-shaped tokamak reactors.

== DATA

2TB of data was provided by two major fusion facilities: the DIII-D National Fusion Facility in
California and the Joint European Torus (JET) in the UK.
It was not mentioned what the data consists of exactly.

== METHODS

A recurrent convolutional neural network.

== RESULTS

Trained on a set of test runs from JET, the Fusion Research Neural Network (FRNN) was applied
to other test runs and could predict impending disruptions with 90% accuracy, in
timescales of milliseconds. On a live system, that would be quick enough to take preventive
measures and save the test run.  This was completely beyond the ability of systems trying to
calculate disruptions from raw sensor readings.  So, it is a major step in achieving fusion as
an energy sources.

== ISSUES

An issue is that as plasmas fluctuate their behaviour is a complex mix of fluid dynamics and
electromagnetism, which is hard to predict and control, and when it does happen it happens
very quickly with a large release of energy which will damage the vessel.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I found this story very interesting as it not only explains that a large step towards fusion, but
it was enabled by a field which I have much interest in, that being machine meaning.
It would have been nice to have read about the specific data that was used to training the model,
something that was not mentioned in the article.
