== GOAL

Using AI and machine learning to reduce government fraud

== DATA

Electronic records, contracts, emails, text messages and bank transfers.

== METHODS

Supervised

== RESULTS

Algorithms are transforming agency performance in many areas and helping to improve worker productivity, service delivery, and financial oversight. Using AI and machine learning algorithms government fraud can be reduced in different areas like education, finance and operations.

== ISSUES

 Procurement obstacles, insufficiently trained workers, data limitations, a lack of technical standards, cultural barriers to organizational change, and making sure anti-fraud applications adhere to responsible AI principles.
 Although AI tools exist for fraud detection and financial oversight, it is not always easy to implement them operationally, introduce new digital tools, or integrate them into agency missions. There are a few barriers to AI and machine learning innovation in the federal government. 
 If the data come in non-standard or unstructured form, it becomes more difficult to make effective use of that information. It is hard to input the material, difficult to compare, and challenging to analyse the material. 
 Data sharing remains a main challenge as well.


== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

AI and machine learning are very well-suited for fraud detection because of the amount of digital information and ease of analysing both text and data. 
Reporting in the press is reasonable and stuffs included was reasonable. Method used was not new.
