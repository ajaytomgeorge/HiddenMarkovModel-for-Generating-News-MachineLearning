==== AGENT

Engineers at Beihang University and Microsoft China

==== GOAL

To develop a bot that reads and comments on online news articles to get people to interact and engage with the content.

==== DATA

They got their data by creating a Chinese dataset made by crawling Tencent News, a popular Chinese websites of news and opinion articles, and an English dataset built by crawling news articles and comments from Yahoo News.

==== METHODS

They created a system made up of two neural networks: a reading network and a generation network. The reading network represents the title and the body of the article seperately in a presentation layer, then forms a representation of the entire article by fusing the title into the body through a fusion layer. This is then fed into the generation network to create a comment. 

==== RESULTS

They created a bot that commented on different news articles. A lot of critiques towards the research say there is a risk that people might use this technology to feign comments coming from people for purposes of political manipulation or persuasion.
