== AGENT

Christopher Thomas.(an AI and Deep learning practitioner and researcher)

== GOAL

To colourise black and white images

== DATA

The Div2k training dataset

== METHODS

Supervised

== RESULTS

Mostly positive results but some results didn't look believable at first glance
and some were only clearly wrong when you compare them to the actual color image.

== ISSUES

Had trouble predicting some nature images with very bright colours like making
a bright parrot just a dull green.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

Unbelievable how an algorithm can predict the colours on a black and white image
that might have never had a coloured version. Some results were quite dissapointing
however I give credit to the developer for showing where the machine went wrong also.
