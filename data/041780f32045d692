==== AGENT
Smart Protection
==== GOAL
Smart Protection is working to help brands and rightsholders identify online hubs that host illegal 
streams, downloads, and other types of content infringement.
==== DATA
By scanning the web, Smart Protection effectively builds a huge database of URLs, and it then applies 
its various machine learning algorithms that have been tailored to each content type and classifies 
the URLs based on the likelihood that they are hosting illicit content.
==== METHODS
when Smart Protection’s platform identifies a URL it thinks may be hosting infringing content, 
it still has to eliminate false positives. Where there are doubts, Smart Protection works with 
analysts to manually pore over the identified websites before deciding whether a URL has been 
correctly identified, which in turn helps improve the company’s machine learning systems.
==== RESULTS
The company is a member of Google’s Trusted Copyright Removal Program (TCRP), which allows Smart 
Protection to detect infractions and have the offending URL removed swiftly — the company said it 
has delisted more than 11 million hyperlinks on Google since its inception. And it has similar 
arrangements in place with most of the major platforms.
