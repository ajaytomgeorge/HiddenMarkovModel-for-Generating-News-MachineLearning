GOAL:
		To train a binary classifier on the Adult dataset, to predict whether an individualâ€™s income is greater or less than $50,000.

DATA:
		Drag the Adult Census Income Binary Classification dataset. the data comtains person's income informations eg, person's age hours per week ect. 

METHODS:
		Add a Clean Missing Data module, and use the default settings, to replace missing values with zeros. Connect the dataset module output to the input port.
		Add a Project Columns module, and connect the output of Clean Missing Data module to the input port.
		Use the column selector to exclude these columns: workclass, occupation, and native-country. 
		Add a Split module to create the testing and test sets. 
		Add a Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree module to initialize a boosted decision tree classifier.
		Add a Train Model module and connect the classifier (step 5) and the training set (left output port of the Split module) 
		to the left and right input ports respectively. 
		Add a Score Model module and connect the trained model and the test set (right port of the Split module).This module will make the predictions. 
		Add an Evaluate Model module and connect the scored dataset to the left input port.


RESULTS:
		They find that the Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree is fairly accurate in predicting income for the Adult Census Income dataset.

COMMENTS:
Machine learning is very useful in predicting things, and it usually gives a fairly accuracy prediction.
