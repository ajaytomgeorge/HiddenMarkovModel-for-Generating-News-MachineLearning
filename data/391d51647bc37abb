Gonzalez & R. Karoumi. BWIM aided damage detection in bridges using machine learning, Journal of Civil Structural Health Monitoring, 5 (2015) 715-725]. ==== METHODSThe method, then, consists of four stages: (1) collection of data in both reference condition (i.e. when the state of preservation of the structure is known) and current one; (2) pre-processing of acceleration time histories aimed at extracting characteristics of the crossing train (i.e. running direction, speed and number of axles); ) training of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Gaussian Processes using data collected in reference condition and (4) health classification of the bridge in current condition through the comparison between predicted and measured responses.==== RESULTSResults show the effectiveness of the technique in detecting anomalies at each train passage. However, the reliability of the detection increases with the number of tested passages. Moreover, by applying the technique to several train passages, an indication of the approximate location of the anomaly is possible as well.==== COMMENTSThis is one of the most useful experiment and will help save tremendous amount of money spent on service and labor to keep a check on the railway lines all the time. This is tested only with one railway line data from northern Italy, to understand if the results are right, they need to test it in different types of places and tracks and verify the efficiency.
