== GOAL

Use machine learning to predict earthquakes

== DATA

Christchurch quake was that it was one of the most well-documented earthquakes in history, this data was then used to build an algorithm.

== METHODS

The reasearches used supervised learning to train the algorithm

== RESULTS

The researchers developed a machine learning model that predicted the amount of lateral movement that occurred when the Christchurch earthquake caused soil to lose its strength and shift relative to its surroundings.

== ISSUES

None

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

One of the most useful and lifesaving projects I've come across. Really hope the algorithm advances and the predition becomes more accurate.
The aritcle only covered a small bit of imformation, would've liked to see more tests of the algorithm in different countries with different soil types.
The article didnt not talk much about the methods used to train the data but from what I read I assume they used the supervised method.
