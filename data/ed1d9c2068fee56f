Predicting the level of generalized anxiety disorder of the coronavirus pandemic among college age students using artificial intelligence technology

== DATA

Students answered the online survey voluntarily after reading the reason behind the study in google form. The survey was anonymous.

== METHODS

Neural network model 

== RESULTS

This research focused on applying several machine learning classifiers to predict the level of students' anxiety in Covid- 19 pandemics. Level of anxiety score was calculated based on the (GAD-7) which categorizes level of anxiety to none, mild, moderate, and severe.

== ISSUES
