==== AGENT

Microsoft China and Beihang University.

==== GOAL

The goal was to generate fake engagement on article comment threads in order to gain traction 
and attract other users to read and comment. This is done by generating comments that would 
encourage real users to engage on the thread.

==== DATA

The data was taken from online articles and their titles in the form of text. The main data 
points would be the key words that heavily relate to the title. It is trained off two date sets; A 
Chinese dataset and an English dataset

==== METHODS

Two neural networks were used; One to read the article, comprehend the content and identify key 
points in the article, and another to generate comments based on the points from the article.

==== RESULTS

The DeepCom bot seemed to operate well, but according to Microsoft's reseach team there are quite a few 
risks with having AI pretend to be human in a comment thread. Microsoft have acknowledged these 
risks and added the acknowledgment of these risks in there most recent paper. There is a risk that 
the bot will be used for the purpose of political manipulation/persuasion, and is therefore not available 
for deployment

==== COMMENTS

The article raises concerns about the AI being biased from the articles it gets its data from, this seems 
like a pointless concern. In the case where it is only being used as a way to improve engagement, biased 
and possibly over opinionated comments seems like a great way to get other users to engage. The more neutral
an opinion is, the less likely it is to stir up controversy or any sort of discussion
