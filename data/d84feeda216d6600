Planning Flexible Maintenance for Heavy Trucks using Machine Learning Models, Constraint Programming, and Route Optimization
SAE International Journal of Materials and Manufacturing, Vol. 10, No. 3 (July 2017), pp. 306-315

==== AGENT

Jonas Biteus, Tony Lindgren

==== GOAL

Efficient use of vehicles to perform transport tasks to avoid maintanance, delays and income loss
Have better systems for fleet management.

==== DATA

Three sources:
-Database with historical operational data which include information based on on-board sensors 
showing how each truck has been used on average (air pressure, engine load, gear selections, air 
consumption from Scania trucks)
-Database containing the configuration of each vehicle that has been used 
-Information from Scania workshops containing information if components have been replaced or not(Replaced 
products are assumed faulty)


==== METHODS

Used a random forest model to make a multitude of decision trees

==== RESULTS

Using a 'forest' of 500 trees that delivered on better route optimisation, maintanance planning and maintanance assessment.
This resulted in massive savings for the company in better fleet management

==== COMMENTS

This fleet management system cannot handle any outside unexpected factors such as vehicle accidents or unforseen delays on the road
or any other unexpected event. A live and adaptable system would be better in this situation.
