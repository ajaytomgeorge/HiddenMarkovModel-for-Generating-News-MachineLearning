==== AGENT

This project was developed by engineers at Beihang University and Microsoft China.

==== GOAL

Their aim was to develop a bot that reads online news articles and comments on them.
This would then encourage human users to engage with articles.

==== DATA

They used two datasets for training.
One of them is a Chinese dataset that consisted of news and opinion articles from a popular Chinese website.
The other is an English dataset comprising of news articles and comments from Yahoo News.
There is a mix of opinion pieces, editorialised pieces and journalism.

==== METHODS

They based the algorithm on how humans consume news online.
For this, they implemented two neural networks.
The first is a reading network that tries to comprehend an article and then identifies the key points in it.
The second is a generation network that writes a comment based on the article title and the important points that it gathered.

==== RESULTS

Providing an example of how the bot comments, they proved that through the analysis of news articles, the bot is able to generate comments that are relevant and informative.
However they also admit that there were risks involved with developing a bot pretending to be human.
For one, the fact that the bot was trained on a dataset of articles written by humans meant that the articles were undoubtedly biased in a way.
Hence they found that the bot could potentially acquire some of this bias.

==== COMMENTS

In my opinion, the training dataset that they used could have been more varied.
I believe that they could have broadened it by including more websites in more languages.
This could have also helped to reduce the issue of being biased.
