==== AGENT

It was developed by researchers at MIT and the University of California at San Diego (UCSD).

==== GOAL

They were trying to predict incidents of IP hijacking in advance by tracing things back to the hijackers themselves.

==== DATA

They pulled data from several yearsâ€™ worth of network operator mailing lists, as well as historical BGP data taken every five minutes from the global routing table.

==== METHODS

They observed particular qualities of malicious actors and then trained a machine-learning model to automatically identify such behaviors. These included
volatile changes in activity, multiple address blocks, and IP addresses in multiple countries. They then trained a machine-learning model to automatically identify such behaviors.

==== RESULTS

They trained their system to be able to identify roughly 800 suspicious networks and found that some of them had been hijacking IP addresses for years. 
Events that look like IP hijacks can often be the result of human error, or otherwise legitimate. Due to this, they had to manually jump in to identify false positives, 
which accounted for roughly 20 percent of the cases identified by their classifier.

==== COMMENTS

I could not find a link to the paper in the article. 
Due to this, I am not sure what the data exactly looked like.
