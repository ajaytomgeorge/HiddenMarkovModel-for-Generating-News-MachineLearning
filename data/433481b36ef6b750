== AGENT
Google AlphaFold
== GOAL
They were trying to solve the protein folding problem to win the CASP
competition
== DATA
They were given data on protein structures in crystals by the EMBL-EBI
research centre for training their model.
== METHODS
They used deep neural networks to first predict the distances between pairs
of amino acids and also to predict angles between chemical bonds that
connect those amino acids. They also used a separate neural network that
used the distances in aggregate to estimate how close the proposed
structure is to the right answer. This is a means of supervised learning.
== RESULTS
They won the competition with 92.4% accuracy
== ISSUES
I can’t spot anything I would’ve done differently. AlphaFold is phenomenal.
== SCORE
9
== COMMENTS
This was interesting because they managed to solve a massive problem in
biology with extreme accuracy. Incredible work.
