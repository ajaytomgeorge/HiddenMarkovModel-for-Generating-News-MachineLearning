== GOAL

This paper analyzes the history and present situation of artificial intelligence in game development, and puts forward 
the possible changes and impacts of artificial intelligence technology based on machine learning on game development in the future.

== DATA

Taking Chinese chess as an example, the existing AI technology can only simply control the search depth of the 
state tree and evaluate the complexity of the function. 

== METHODS

The main methods used for implementing AI into game development are using Intelligent game design and Artificial Intelligence Routing.

== RESULTS

At present, the traditional in-game artificial intelligence can still fulfill the mission entrusted by the developers, and 
create realistic intelligence illusion by combining with other audio-visual interactive means.

== ISSUES

More advances can be made by using AI in game development but the issue is that people will get more addicted to such advanced versions and
eventually get away from reality. 

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

Games with the help of AI and machine learning can be made more advanced and interesting but at the same time importance 
should be given to the fact that such advances can lead to addiction among gamers and also start to lose a sense of reality and world 
around them.
