== AGENT

Who did this machine-learning-related work (e.g., Netflix)

== GOAL

To determine the capacity of machine learning models to build unified, interpretable, and explainable models of crop behaviour, and highlight the powerful role of data in the future of food.

== DATA

By linking satellite data to a freely available ‘big’ dataset, the Australian National Variety Trials (NVTs), they developed a framework to train and test accurate ML models and extract meaningful and testable hypotheses from ML models.

== METHODS

The used unsupervised machine learning

== RESULTS

Machine learning provided clear and accurate predictive models across a broad array of challenges.

== ISSUES

Lack of data avaiable to make predictions with high accuracy

== SCORE

3
