== GOAL

To Predict Risk of Schizophrenia Using a Blood Test using machine learning

== DATA

DNA methylation data on whole blood of 414 SZ cases and 433 non-psychiatric controls were used as training data for a classification algorithm with built-in feature selection.
Using the first two SPLS-DA dimensions they calculated a “risk distance” to identify individuals with the highest probability of SZ. 
The model used was then evaluated on an independent data set on 353 SZ cases and 322 non-psychiatric controls.

== METHODS

The strategy applied a machine learning algorithm called SPLS-DA to analyze specific regions of the human genome called CoRSIVs, 
hoping to reveal epigenetic markers for the condition. 

== RESULTS

Researchers applied machine learning to analyze the CoRSIVs region of the human genome to identify the schizophrenia biomarkers.
Testing the model with an independent data set revealed the AI technology can detect schizophrenia with 80% accuracy.

Their CoRSIV-based model classified 303 individuals as cases with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 80%, far surpassing the performance of a model based on polygenic risk score (PRS). 
Risk distance (based on CoRSIV methylation) was not associated with medication use, arguing against reverse causality.

"Our findings are very exciting. They not only suggest the possibility of predicting risk of schizophrenia early in life, but also outline a new approach that may be applicable to other diseases."

== ISSUES

I had no issues with the news article, it was inspiring and I had no real issues with the idea.

== COMMENTS

I found this news article to be inspring to what machine learning can bring to the world of medicine and health.
The posibility of predicting schizophrenia wouldn't have been a possibility without machine learning.
I hope this can be applied to much wide spread and fatal diseases like Cancer.
