== GOAL
A general purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems.
== DATA
They used a variety of datasets to train and test their network. Some of
which are called “Cityscapes”, “Sketch” and “CVUSA” in the “Code & Data”
section of the latter link in the Source section of this review.
== METHODS
This uses a Conditional-GAN framework. The conditioning image, x is applied
to the input to the generator and as input to the discriminator. The
learning is supervised.
== RESULTS
It is very hard to evaluate the performance of such a project, however,
they did use
== ISSUES
I don’t see any issues with the work. The outputs look amazing and there
isn’t a clear way to evaluate the work even if I were to try do so.
== SCORE
8
== COMMENTS
This was really interesting to me. I tried the pix2pix sandbox and it
looked very realistic. This could be used to generate images for more
serious things such as maps.
