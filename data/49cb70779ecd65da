== GOAL

To power its mobile app by artificial intelligent engine, to deliver real time news and information to digital cosmopolitans. 

== DATA

A artificial intelligence engine, has been trained by using a database with over a million articles in different languages, applying state of the art models of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 

== METHODS

It uses supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms powered by Deep Learning.

== RESULTS

This technology includes machine learning classification, interlanguage clustering, news topics ranking, extraction-based summarization and other features to help filter news for different types of users and for different types of applications. 

== ISSUES

It has a multiclass and multilingual classifier. It also generates extractive short summaries of news in various languages. This is much more than a simple news filtering tool. However high-quality datasets, prebuilt would power the next innovation. 

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

It is trained to automatically crawl and aggregate news from open web sources with a set of skills to understand contents and define the relevant articles to the final recipient.
