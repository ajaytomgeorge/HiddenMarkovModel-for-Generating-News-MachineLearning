==== GOAL

Using machine learning to accurately translate japanese to english with accurate translations
of tense, aspect and modality and get better results than the commonly used machine translation

==== DATA

Three data sets:
-Set containing 1-gram to 10-gram strings at the ends of input japanese sentences and all the morphemes from each
of the sentences. (422338 features)
-Set containing 1-gram to 10-gram strings at the ends of input japanese sentences. (195841 features)
-Set of all the morphemes from all the sentences (226497 features)

==== METHODS

Using four different methods, k-nearest neighborhood, decision list, maximum entropy and support vector machine 
to develope translators

==== RESULTS

The system at its lowest had an accuracy of 94.3% and was compared against a gold standard set of translations that was
translated by 3 individual seperate translators

==== COMMENTS

The translator produced from this was of a better quality than the standard machine translators that were commercially availble.
The ML system was able to translate and learn from past experiences on the complicated translations that would not fit direct translation
but would need some level of understanding. It leads me to wonder if the google translating functions work by ML or by rule based direct translation
