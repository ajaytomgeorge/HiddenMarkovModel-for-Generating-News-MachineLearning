==== AGENT

Biomedical engineers at Duke University 

==== GOAL

The goal of the project was to model the interactions between complex variables in engineered bacteria using machine learning

==== DATA

They used one hundred thousand data simulations to train the neural network with 13 variables such as growth rate and cellular movement.

==== METHODS

By using the one hundred thousand data simulations to train the neural network the similarities between the bacteria which would result is certain patterns.
and from those be able to predict what the result would be for any future inputted bacteria sample. such as if it was going to be a two or triple ring bacteria.


==== RESULTS

The project was a success, machine learning decreased the run time of the calculations required by a factor off three hundred thousand times more efficient.
this brought the calculations from several hundred years down to just several months.

==== COMMENTS

From reading this case of machine learning it shows me that the potential for predicting the likelihood of someone developing multiple cells (cancer) or 
other harmful bacteria is becoming closer to reality. Using machine learning people may be able to receive an indication on whether or not 
they will become ill soon, which would mean the illness could either be caught early or even prevented.
