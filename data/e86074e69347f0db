==== AGENT

Researchers from the Data Science Center for Creative Design and Manufacturing at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Research Organization of Information and Systems, in Japan.

==== GOAL

Searching for shortcuts and ways to cut the time it takes for traditional new high-performance material discovery and thus discovering new polymer materials which are more conductive as polymers traditionally are not conductive.

==== DATA

Received data from the PoLyInfo database which is the largest database of polymers in the world. The data-set used was still small however due to the database having a limited amount of data on the heat-transfer properties of polymers.

==== METHODS

The researchers used a machine learning method called transfer learning to minimise the impact of having limited data on thermal conductivity. They created a forward prediction model that described various polymeric properties. The pretrained models they had were then fine tuned onto the target property. They then inverted the trained forward models which created a model conditioned by a desired property requirement. The ML method could then make materials that have the desired properties. 

==== RESULTS

They identified three thermal-conductive polymers which were selected for synthesis and processing. After Tests they found these new polymers have thermal-conductivity which is 80 percent higher than other polyimides.

==== COMMENTS

The outcome of this paper seems to have vast implications on the discovery of new useful materials. The Machine Learning method also only acted on a very small dataset and produced these results. With more data the potential for greater discoveries is huge.
