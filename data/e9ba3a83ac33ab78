IBM Watson Oncology.

==== GOAL

The goal is to use data and machine learning to make medication and medical treatments more personalised and not just to
rely on generic treatments that the health services are currently offering.

==== DATA

The data used in personalised medical treatment are the patients genetic information, their family history and their medical
history.

==== METHODS

Personalised medical treatment uses deep learning which is a specialised machine learning approach based on the multiple-
layered structures of artificial neurons. These neurons are able to process information and learn by adjusting the weights
at each neuron allowing for an accurate prediction to be made. These deep networks are capable of learning from large amounts
of data and are then able to apply this learning to new unseen data. Deep learning systems are able to integrate data from an
individual patient and allow better predictions and recommendations for treatment options to patients based on individual
characteristics.


==== RESULTS

Deep learning systems are very well suited for the large amounts of healthcare data and out perform the more traditional
statistical models that had previously existed.


==== COMMENTS

The area of health care personalisation is a fine challenge for todays deep learning systems.
