Research

== GOAL

A robotic arm which can pick out your lost items locating RFID tags attached to your items.

== DATA

Not specified

== METHODS

Reinforcement learning

== RESULTS

The robot arm using a camera and a radio frequency antenna, it can using the signal from the antenna and visual input from the camera pick out items with RFID tags on them. Even if they are buried or visually not detectable. 

== ISSUES
	
The system periodically stops to take re-measurements to locate where an items is.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Very exciting to see machine learning paired not as a sole driver but part of a coherent system being able to detect things in space.
