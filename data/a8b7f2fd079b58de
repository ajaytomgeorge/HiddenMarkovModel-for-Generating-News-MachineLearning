The Epinions website is a social platform where users can exchange their opinions on different types of articles. The second dataset is FileTrust data set was extracted from FilmTrust. This data set has two files, rating.txt and trust.txt. ratings.txt contains 35,497 data records, which has three attributes (userid, movieid and movieRating).==== METHODSThe traditional recommender systems ignore the friendships among users. They just utilize the user-item matrix to generate recommendation. In fact, we often need to listen to the recommendations of friends intentionally or unintentionally according to the following rules: (1) The recommendations of the users who have the same or similar tastes or favors. (2) The recommendations of the experts in some field. Based on the above two considerations, the proposed matrix factorization framework with social regularization [3]. In order to achieve better recommender results, the suitable group of friends are clustered and the shortest path is calculated and the correlations among users and items. Friendships and tags are combined as regularization terms to constrain the matrix factorization framework. So, they have taken the realistic situation that the friends with different favors recommend different results into consideration.==== RESULTSThe experimental results show that this combination outperforms the traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and can avoid the cold start problem. Moreover, they used different metrics to evaluate the performance and accuracy of our recommender system.==== COMMENTSThey have mentioned that this method out perform the traditional methodology but not a detailed explanation of how different it is from the traditional recommender system which is required to analyse the difference between the two models
