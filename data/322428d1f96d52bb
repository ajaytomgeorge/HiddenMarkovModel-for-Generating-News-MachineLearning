==== AGENT

A NASA Frontier Development Lab 

==== GOAL

To show that by using deep learning, it is possible to virtually monitor the Sun's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance

==== DATA

data consisted of coronal images from NASA's SDO

==== METHODS

inferring what ultraviolet radiation levels that a sensor would have detected based on what the other instruments on SDO are observing at any given time

==== RESULTS

They demonstrated that it is possible to use imaging observations of the Sun to create a proxy measurement of EUV spectral irradiance with an accuracy that surpasses physics based models

==== COMMENTS

Interesting piece on space weather and the application of a combination of data science and machine learning. Perhaps one day we will use NN algorithims to predict the weather on mars or the sun
