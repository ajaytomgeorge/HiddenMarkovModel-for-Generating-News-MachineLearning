====GOAL 

Automation of plant studies 

====DATA 

3-D scans of the plant are taken with lasers to have a visualization of the plant architecture. 

====METHOD 

Plants are monitors by the machine learning program using 3-D laser scanning. 

====RESULTS 

This will help speed up the process of plant studies and take less manpower. 

====COMMENTS 

With this we can see how machine learning is replacing the need for humans.
