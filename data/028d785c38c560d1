==== GOAL

Estimate a patients risk of cardiovascular death from a ECG signal

==== DATA

Data was taken from patients ECG signals.

==== METHODS

The signals were seperated into seperate beats and labeled by the team whether the signal was from a patient that died or a patient that survived

==== RESULTS

New patients have been given risk scores by the system to identify high risk patients who were at risk of dying in the next year

==== COMMENTS

Seems like a good way to find current or upcoming heart conditions that could cause death in a year but wouldnt make allowances for medical anomalys.
