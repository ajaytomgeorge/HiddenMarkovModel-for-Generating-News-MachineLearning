== GOAL

solve the problem of needing to spend long periods of time collecting data to teach neural-network powered bots to recognise and manipulate objects in their environment.

== DATA

The data from the test with CLIPort and RN50-BERT were performed by themselves and displayed in their own paper.
It displayed a series of tests with seen and unseen variables. Seen: Shown in demonstration, Unseen: Not shown in demonstration.
As a sub-category, they also performed n-demonstrations in front of the machine to learn from (n = 1, 10, 100, 1000).
The results showed the percentage of successful attempts under each sub-category.

== METHODS

For object recognition, CLIP was used as it's real-life performance is much better compared to competitors like ImageNet & ResNet101.
Algorithms were also used to recognise colours, depth and language processing.
For learning, they underwent supervised learning. The machine monitored n expert demonstrations (n = 1, 10, 100, 1000).

== RESULTS

The CLIPort performs better overall compared to competitors.

== ISSUES

While the training and comparison of end results with competition seemed impartial and free of bias and contamination, they were simulated and purposely used noiseless cameras.
This would differ from industrial scenarios where noise can be quiet common with all the other machinery and signals present in a factory.
Objects that CLIP hasn't been trained to recognised will not be recognised by a CLIPort robot. This means that CLIPort is dependent on CLIP being completely up to date or a custom objects will need to be manually trained into the robot.

== COMMENTS

Your comments on this: did you think it was interesting and why, would
you have done it differently, was the reporting in the Press
reasonable or did they get lots of stuff wrong, etc. Was the method new,
or was it interesting new data, or an interesting new way of using existing
data and methods?
