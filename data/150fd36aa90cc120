== GOAL

Use machine learning to optimize quality inspections in the press shop.

== DATA

They use images as their data.

== METHODS

They used the unsupervised method to train their network as the algorithm learns independently from examples to detect cracks.

== RESULTS

A network which detects cracks on cars.

== ISSUES

Their biggest challenges was to get a sufficiently large database to train the network.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

This project is good use for vision systems.
If I was the one working on the project I would've tested the network on various makes and models of cars and vans to see how accurate the algorithm really is.
The press did a good job with documenating the project, they outlined all the major parts and were able to deliver a good report.
The method used to train the networks seems to fit well, the reseachers also had a team making the cracks in the sample images with pixel precision to train the network.
