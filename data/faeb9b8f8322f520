==== GOAL

They are trying to use Artificial intelligence to help data centres to run more efficiently.

==== DATA

They compared human handwritten algorithms to their systems algorithms across datacentres.

==== METHOD

They used reinforced learning to train the systems how to schedule data-processing operations across thousands of servers. 
They were concerned that some workload sequences are more difficult than others so they used a technique called baselining which takes the average of scenarios with a larger number of variable and uses those averages to as a baseline to compare future results .


==== RESULTS

The researcher’s system completes jobs about 20 to 30 percent faster compared to the best handwritten scheduling algorithms, and twice as fast during high-traffic times. The system learns how to compact workloads efficiently to leave little waste.
The results where positive and indicated the system could enable data centres to handle the same workload at higher speeds, using fewer resources.

==== COMMENTS

The type of data and how much they used is not given in the artical.
