== AGENT

PLoS Biology

== GOAL

To Identify the next animal virus that is capable of infecting humans,

== DATA

With a dataset of 861 viral species with known zoonotic status, the researchers collected a single representative genome sequence from the hundreds of RNA and DNA virus species, spanning 36 viral families.

== METHODS

The used gradient boosted classification trees and clustering so, supervised and unsupervised learning were both used.

== RESULTS

Across the full dataset, 77.2% of viruses predicted to have very high zoonotic potential were known to infect humans.

== ISSUES

I dont see many issues with the work other than their results mightnt be that accurate for some cases as even though they applied their models, a 
considerable numbers of viruses may need to undergo confirmatory testing (e.g., infectivity experiments on human-derived cell lines)


== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I thought it was very interesting to know people are looking to prevent another virus like COVID from effecting the whole world again. 
The news article was interesting but was misssing some important information like how it was trained and a more indept view of the results and tests.
The results shown on the article was a brief quote from the researchers but when I actually read the paper and I could see they were missing quite abit.
Altought the article didnt have all of the information it did show the link to the actual paper which I found really helpful to get a more indept view 
of the project. The method of testing was very interesting
