University of California, Berkeley by Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros

==== GOAL

The goal of the project was to develop an automatic approach which would be able to create realistic
colorisation's of old black and white photos and also black and white movies.

==== DATA

The data used was a set of 1.5 million colour photos of images ranging from landscape, to people and animals.

==== METHODS

The team approached the problem by posing it as a classification problem using class-rebalancing at
training time. The machine learning method that the team used was a feed-forward pass in a convolutional
neural network that was trained using over 1 million colour images. The method that the team used to train
the machine learning algorithm was to decompose millions of colour images. These images were decompose into
two separate parts, the black and white component and the colour component. After the model had been successful
trained a black and white image could then by fed into the model which would generate a coloured version of the
image.

==== RESULTS

The team successfully managed to build the model that could apply realistic colour to old black and white
photos and movies.

==== COMMENTS

I think that this project shows how machine learning can be applied to many areas of industries where one
would not immediately think that computer science would be applicable.
