==== AGENT

ComplyRadar

==== GOAL

The goal is to utilise machine learning to prevent money laundering and other prominant forms of financial
cybercrime. 

==== DATA

The data being analysed is uncategorised data in the form of users accounts and the regular
activity of these accounts, along with the transactions made. 

==== METHODS

ComplyRadar monitors transactions by analysing individuals, accounts, and entities in order to detect suspicious
activity. It's machine learning transaction filter provides an additional probabilistic layer on top of the
standard rules engine currently used. 

==== RESULTS

This is drastically reducing false positives while detecting fraudulant behaviour, and also provides additional
data output which would not be stored by the standard rules engine. 

==== COMMENTS

By continously monitoring account activity and transactions, their system will learn to consistantly detect patterns
fraudulant activity, although it seems extremely important that this would be very consistant before release.
