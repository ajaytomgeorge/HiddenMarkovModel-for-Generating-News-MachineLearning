==== GOAL

Their goals are as following:
1) They designed Age-cGAN (Age Conditional Generative
	Adversarial Network), the first GAN to generate high
	quality synthetic images within required age categories.
2) They proposed a novel latent vector optimization approach
	which allows Age-cGAN to reconstruct an input face
	image preserving the original person’s identity.


==== DATA

Stock images of peoples faces where you know their age.

==== METHODS

Their face aging method is based on Age-cGAN, a generative model for synthesis 
of human faces within required age categories.GAN stands for Generative Adversarial
Networks.

==== RESULTS

Initial reconstructions allow “OpenFace” to recognize the original person only in 
half of test examples. This percentage is slightly increased by “Pixelwise” optimization 
but the improvement is marginal. On the contrary, “Identity-Preserving” optimization 
approach preserves the person’s identities much better demonstrating by far the best
face recognition performance of 82.9%.

==== COMMENTS

Face aging technology has a lot of potential. In my opinion it is a pretty cool technology
and has applications from finding missing children to entertainment with face aging apps.
