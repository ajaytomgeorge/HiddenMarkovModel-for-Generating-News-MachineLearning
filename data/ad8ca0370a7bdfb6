Washington State University researchers 

==== GOAL

To use machine learning and game theory to successfully identify bacterial antibiotic resistance 

==== DATA

Researchers have been working to make use of genome sequencing to identify antibiotic-resistant genes, looking for similar sequences of genes in public databases. This works for identifying well-known antibiotic-resistant genes, but doesn’t hold up with new or unusual genes. To help identify new or unsual genes, game theory was used. 

==== METHODS

Using their machine learning algorithm and game theory approach, the researchers looked at the interactions of several features of the genetic material, including its structure and the physiochemical, evolutionary, and composition properties of protein sequences rather than simply its sequence similarity.

==== RESULTS

By employing machine learning and game theory, the researchers were able to determine with 93 to 99 percent accuracy the presence of antibiotic-resistant genes in three different types of bacteria.
