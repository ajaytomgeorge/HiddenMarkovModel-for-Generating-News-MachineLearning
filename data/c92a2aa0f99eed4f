==== AGENT

Goncalo Abreu, Rui Neves, Nuno Horta from University of Lisbon.

==== GOAL

Prediction of Currency exchange using an hybrid system using machine learning techniques together with genetic algorithms and technical analysis.

==== DATA

The EUR/USD pair is used to test and validate the algorithm.

==== METHODS

An architecture for automatic feature selection to optimize the cross validated 
performance estimation of a Naive Bayes model using a genetic algorithm.

==== RESULTS

The new architecture improves the return on investment of the unop-timized system from 0.43% to 10.29%

==== COMMENTS

Though the ROI is maximized by a large extent, including the fundamentals like brexit, Inflation data can give even more attractive returns.
