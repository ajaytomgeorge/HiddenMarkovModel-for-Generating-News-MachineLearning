Biomedical engineers from Duke University

==== GOAL

To train a neural network to predict the circular patterns that would be generated by a biological circuit embedded into a bacterial culture.

==== DATA

The data consisted of 13 bacterial variables such as the rates of growth, diffusion, protein degradation and cellular movement.

==== METHODS

A deep neural network was used to make the predictions. With each iteration the weights and biases were tweaked as new training data was fed into the network. The researchers trained four separate neural networks and compared their answers for each instance. 

==== RESULTS

The system worked 30,000 times faster than the existing computational model. When each of the trained neural networks made similar predictions, these predictions were found to be close to the right answer. In the initial 100,000 data simulations used to train the neural network, only one produced a bacterial colony with three rings but in future iterations more triplets were found and the variables crucial for their production were determined. The approach also worked on a on a biologic system that operated randomly.


==== COMMENTS

This study was very encouraging as it proves that mahcine learning can be applied to a wide variety of biological and medical fields. I thought the team made excelellent use of the fact that the machine learning models used in the study expediated a process which might otherwise have taken years.
