== AGENT

Google, Nvidia, and probably other tech giants

== GOAL

Cut down on the time required to design ASICc (Application Specific Integrated Circuits)

== DATA

They used a set of different placements for which they already knew their corresponding value.

== METHODS

They used Supervised learning, followed by reinforcement learning.

== RESULTS

They cut down design time for one of the design stages from months to 6 hours.

== ISSUES

I don't see any issues with this whatsoever.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I thought this was interesting, and maybe slightly frightening, as it's a computer designing another computer (part). This could be the long-winded start of a really technical sci-fi movie.
