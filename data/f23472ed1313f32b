== GOAL

Forecasting the status of Covid-19 situation using Supervised Machine Learning Models.

== DATA

Data is extracted by Github repository(csse_covid_19_time_serie) provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University.

== METHODS

Linear Regression, LASSO Regression, Support Vector Machine, Exponential Smoothing.
== RESULTS

The system in this article predicts future death-rate, new cases identified, recovery-rate. Experimenting with four models, Exponential Smoothing mode performs better than rest models. 

== ISSUES

It is challenging to make decision boundaries that helps in classification of given data points.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

This study is very useful in current pandemic situation that really helps government to plan strategies that can curb positivity rate.
I would have considered the location of the covid patients and identify the areas that are hot-spot for the covid spread.
