Researchers from USC and the University of Pennsylvania

== GOAL

Use ML to pick visitors for COVID-19 checks as they were unable to test every tourist and unable to turn them away

== DATA

Incoming travelers filled out a questionnaire detailing the country and region they were coming from as well as their age and gender. Based on these
characteristics, the algorithm selected whether they should be tested for COVID-19 upon arrival. It would then take in the test results as feedback and learn from them.

== METHODS

Used multi-armed bandit algorithms, reinforcement learning

== RESULTS

The code identified 1.85 times as many asymptomatic, infected travelers as random testing methods "with up to 2-4 times as many during peak travel"
It also identified 1.25-1.45 times as many asymptomatic, infected travelers as testing policies that only utilize epidemiological metrics.

== ISSUES

An ethical concern is that there's a high chance of the algorithm being racist, much like "random" checks at airports.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I thought this was interesting, especially because it was a good example of what reinforcement learning is, where the algorithm was both attempting to learn about 
and solve a problem at the same time. The reporting in the press was reasonable. The method wasn't new but it was an interesting way of solving a problem using
machine learning.
