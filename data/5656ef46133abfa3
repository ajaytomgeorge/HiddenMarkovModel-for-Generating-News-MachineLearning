== GOAL

Trying to create an AI system that can detect breast cancer in ultrasound pictures with radiologist-level accuracy.

== DATA

The AI system was developed and evaluated using the NYU Breast Ultrasound Dataset41 consisting of 5,442,907 images within 288,767 breast US exams 
collected from 143,203 patients examined between 2012 and 2019 at NYU Langone Health in New York, USA.The dataset included 28,914 exams associated 
with a pathology report, and among those,the biopsy or surgery yielded benign and malignant results for 26,843 and 5593 breasts, respectively.

== METHODS

Patients in the dataset were randomly divided into a training set (60%) that was used for model training, a validation set (10%) that was used for hyperparameter tuning, and an internal test
set (30%) that was used for model evaluation.

== RESULTS

With the help of the AI, radiologists decrease their false positive rates by 37.3% and reduce requested biopsies by 27.8%, while maintaining the same level of sensitivity. 
This highlights the potential of AI in improving the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of breast ultrasound diagnosis.

== ISSUES

The issues with this approach is the relatively high level of sophistication involved and expenses that are required to achieve the output successfully.  

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

Using AI for medical research and improvement of already present treatment methods are very much appreciable. This will increase the effeciency of detection and prevention of such diseases in the future.
