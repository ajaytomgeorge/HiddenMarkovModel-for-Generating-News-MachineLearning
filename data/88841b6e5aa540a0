== GOAL

The aim of this research is to dig deep on the topic that whether the robots are stealing humans jobs or solving labour shortages.

== DATA

Most critical worker shortages the UK are in transportation and logistics. By one estimate, the country is currently short of at 
least 100,000 truck drivers. Amazon now operates more than 200,000 of these robots at its distribution centres worldwide, 
while Ocado employs more than 1,000 at a single facility in Andover in Hampshire.

== METHODS

The UK-based startup Small Robot Company, for example, has developed two robots capable of killing weeds in wheat fields while 
cutting down dramatically on the use of chemical pesticides. The first robot autonomously prowls a wheat field, and with precision 
and patience that no human could match analyses each individual wheat plant using several cameras, mapping the exact locations 
where weeds are beginning to encroach. Once this data has been collected, a second, somewhat frightening, five-armed 
robot follows, killing the weeds by administering a powerful electric shock.


== RESULTS

More educated white-collar workers will quickly discover that they are by no means exempt from the rise of AI.

== ISSUES

The issue regarding this type of research is that people get tensed and frustrated about their future when they see such headlines 
and it might affect people's overall mindset about technology overall. 

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

Such technological advances are necessary but these type of researches may often lead to ambiguity and more dilemma with 
many as these headlines are more than enough to cause chaos.
