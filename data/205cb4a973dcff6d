== GOAL
Evaluating Machine Learning techniques for archaeological lithic sourcing 

== DATA 
Data generated from 118 Meesolithic artefacts from 12 Archarological sites data 

== METHODS
Random Forests, K Nearest Neighbous and Support Vector Machines 

== RESULTS
The results presented here demonstrate a robust machine learning pipeline for archaeological lithic sourcing, with the important addition of outlier detection.

== ISSUES
The key issues are the adequacy of sampling quantity, and the point at which these groups should be further separated into different classes based on inspection of the data.

== SCORE
7

==COMMENTS
It is a great approach to find the geological origin of stone materials or artefacts. Though if deep neural networks wouldâ€™ve been used with more data, it would give more accuracy.
