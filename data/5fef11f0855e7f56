==== AGENT

A collaboration between software engineers and clinical researchers

==== GOAL

What were they trying to do?
Accuracy detect lung cancer in scans, improving from our human work. Using images to precisely tell if a victim had a certain lung cancer or not.

==== DATA

Where did they get their data? 
They got the data from 6 radiologists and from all their patients (ambiguous source). These x-ray images were then fed through a model and it later gave a 94% accuracy which people will develop lung cancer.




==== METHODS

What did they actually do?
The researchers studied on lung cancer screening for smokers. These lung cancer screening were then fed through a model.


==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?
It gave a 94% accuracy rate for lung cancer in victims and yield 11 percent fewer false positives than the physicians, this research went really well in reducing the error rate of finding cancer.
