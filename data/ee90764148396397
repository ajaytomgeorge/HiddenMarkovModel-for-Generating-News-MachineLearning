== AGENT

Facebook

== GOAL

To build an artificial intelligence program that can “see” what it is looking at.

== DATA

The used over 1 billion public images from Instagram.

== METHODS

Learned how to identify objects in photos by analyzing random, unlabeled and uncurated Instagram images. 
AKA using the technique self-supervised learning.

== RESULTS

The program achieved a “classification accuracy score” of 84.2% when it attempted a test provided by ImageNet.

== ISSUES

I was thinking there could be privacy issues however facebook has stated that 
instagram users agree to let their information to be used for experimental research when they agree to the data policy.
Facebook have a bad history with data like the Cambridge analytical scandal, so they could make more unethical decisions.  

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

I did think it was interesting that facebook are trying to build an AI to 'see' however, its hard to trust a company like Facebook especially when it 
comes to using other peoples data. I do think that their project will only get more accurate over time as they have an unlimited amount of data to constantly train their models with. 
The article was quite interesting but was a bit too small and didnt fit in a lot of information.
