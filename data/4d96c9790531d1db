==== AGENT

A research team at MIT

==== GOAL

Part of clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients involves physicians
working with large datasets of patients. Specifically, the datasets
would contain defining feature(s) of a specific disease/disorder which
the patient suffers from. These physicians would have to identify these
features in order to successfully diagnose and treat patients. As these
datasets grow larger, manually indexing each entry becomes a laborious
task. Per the article, the researchers plan to use machine learning to
work with these databases and classify them so the process would require
less time but also, for example, "to aid in sepsis care", "design safer
chemotherapy regimens", "predict a patient's risk of having breast cancer"
or to predict a patient's risk of "dying in the ICU"


==== DATA

The article does not mention specifically where the data was obtained from
but common sense would point to the research team being in partnership
with one or more hospitals.
The data was in the form of voice-monitoring data from 100 subjects. This
data was captured from "accelerometer sensor mounted on subjects' necks". 
==== METHODS

Initially, the model was trained using supervised learning. Afterwards,
"the model used features automatically extracted from these data to classify,
with high accuracy, patients with and without vocal cord nodules". In other 
words, the model identified voice patterns of people with vocal cord nodules
and used these features "to predict which people do and don't have the disorder".

==== RESULTS

Not only did the model manage to classify each data point "with high accuracy",
the model also "accomplished this task without a large set of hand-labeled data".
The model is also able to be "adapted to learn patterns of any disease or condition".

==== COMMENTS

In medicine, the machine learning agent needs to be accurate
in what it does. As, for example, mislabelling and thus misdiagnosing a patient
through the use of machine learning would be concerning and would lead to distrust
in using machine learning in such an environment. It is great news that machine learning
was highly successful here.
