== GOAL

To advance there reinforcement learning technology and techniques by practicing on the competive game Starcraft.

== DATA

Popular in game build orders from public game data.

== METHODS

Reinforcement learning, Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit(MAB) algorithm.

== RESULTS

The MAB framework was demonstrated to be superior to a few other common/popular solutions.

== ISSUES

The algorithm had a tough time in some matchups picking between the best and second best build order

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

It was really interesting to see that videogames are the next most complicated game for machine
learning to be able to play effectively especially as starcraft is such a complex game.
