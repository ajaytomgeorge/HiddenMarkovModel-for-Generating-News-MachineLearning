==== GOAL

The goal is to autonomously track a Honey Bee colony's development by counting and classifying comb cells. 
This would decrease time-consumption and margin of error.

==== DATA

The data used is the structure of the honeybee colony, how healthy a colony is can be determined by how many 
cells there are per frame, identifying cells in two categories; Brood and food reserve. The data is comes from
a wooden tunnel and extremely high quality cameras, and the data collected would be approximately 2000+ images

==== METHODS

DeepBee encorporates an image classification pipeline using image processing methods, state-of-the-art 
deep learning and Deep Neural Networks to achieve image segmentation and classification.


==== RESULTS

While analysing the entire image of the bee colony, it takes a long time to learn its patterns. When it is
broken up into images from 40x40 pixels up to 500x500 pixels, the ratio of accuracy to computation time yielded 
the best results. 

==== COMMENTS

Deep Learning allows the tedious task of manually checking each cell in a colony, to be done at much greater speed
and accuracy.
