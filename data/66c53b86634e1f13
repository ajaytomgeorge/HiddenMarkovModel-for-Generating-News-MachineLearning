Classifying black and white spruce pollen using layered machine learning

==== GOAL

Taxonomic precision of pollen identification of congeneric species

==== DATA

Two seperate data sources: modern reference material derived from vouchered herbarium specimens
and fossil material from Nelson Lake, samples were taken and expert identifications were made
and fed to the system

==== METHODS

Developed a supervised, layered, instance-based machine-learning classification system that uses 
leave-one-out bias optimization

==== RESULTS

The machine learning algorithm can discriminate between the two grain types with a >93% accuracy

==== COMMENTS

Interesting report on something that is basically just seeds. Although it does free up time for analysists to 
do more research as the two types of seeds are commonly found in different places.
It is expressed in the paper how there is a very definite difference between the seeds but also expresses how it can 
be difficult to discern between them. This is a great application of machine-learning to automate a task that is time
consuming for people but once automated, very quick for machines.
