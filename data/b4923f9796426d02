==== AGENT
Stanford university graduates

==== DATA
histology images were fed into a machine learning algorithm, along with pathologist-determined diagnoses,
training it to distinguish lung cancer from normal tissue, and two different types of lung cancer from each other.
Then he fed in survival data for those slides, letting the system learn how that information correlated with the images.
Finally, he added in new slides that the model hadnâ€™t seen before, and asked the all-important longevity question.

==== GOAL
Provide more accurate predictions into the treatment of cancer.

==== METHODS
The machine learning entity would be fed with images and then learn to output information in relation to the image.
The machine would output data concering the diagnosis, the prognosis, tumor evolution and best drug treatments

==== RESULTS
The implementation was a success as prior to using ML in the treatment of cancer all cancer patients would be lumped
together and treated the same way regardless of the finer details of their cancer.
The computer learned to predict the presence of six forms mutations from the pathology slides
with accuracy ranging from 73 to 86 percent.

==== COMMENTS
I was surpsrised at how the article outlines how cancer is treated, all forms bundled into one category and treated. 
I was glad to see how AI could help treat cancer more systematically and effectively.
