== GOAL

To automatically classify takeaway food outlets, by 10 major cuisine types, based on business name alone.

== DATA

What data did they use: what did it look like and how did they get it?

== METHODS

LSTM, Recurrent Neural Network

== RESULTS

Although accuracy of prediction varied by cuisine type, overall the model (or ‘classifier’) made a correct prediction approximately three out of four times. We demonstrated the potential of the classifier to public health researchers and for surveillance to support decision-making, through using it to characterise nearly 55,000 takeaway food outlets in England by cuisine type, for the first time.

== ISSUES

The keywords used in this modeling might be very strict and might loose out on some very useful food outlets that donot have "takeaway" in their name. Eg: KFC, McDonalds.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

This is great to figure out patterns and correlations between food and the underlying disease that people are prone to.
