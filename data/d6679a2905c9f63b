==== GOAL
The goal is to perform Sentiment Analysis by implementing the Deep Learning model that can recognize and classify human emotions in Netflix reviews.

==== DATA

The model will take a whole review as an input (word after word) and provide percentage ratings for checking whether the review conveys a positive or negative sentiment.
The dataset contains 5000 negative and 5000 positive reviews.


==== METHODS

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning.
A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary
time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.
This model also involves in preprocessing of input before being processed in the model, this involves Uniform Spelling of Words, Removing Special Characters, Word-To-Index, Word Embeddings.

The key to LSTMs is the cell state c(t),a cell state is an additional way to store memory, besides just only using the hidden state h(t).
However, C(t) makes it possible that LSTMs can work with much longer sequences. 

Forget Gate: After getting the hidden state h(t-1 ) of the previous input x(t-1), Forget gate helps us to make decisions about what must be removed from h(t-1) state and thus keeping only relevant stuff.
Input Gate: In the input gate, we decide to add new stuff from the present input x(t) to our present cell state C(t).
Output Gate: The output gate as the name suggests, decides what to output from the current cell state C(t) to the next C(t+1).
For the language model example, since it just saw a subject, it might want to output information relevant to a verb, in case that’s what is coming next.
For example, it might output whether the subject is singular or plural so that we know what form a verb should be conjugated into if that’s what follows next.


==== RESULTS

This model reports the positivity and negativity percentage for all the reveiews in the dataset with a good accuracy by performing Sentiment Analysis.
