These datasets are acquired from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning  [A. Asuncion, D.N., 2007. UCI machine learning repository.

For feature selection, a feature clustering based approach is proposed to find optimal set of features. In order to cluster the features, correlation coefficient between individual feature and class label is used as clustering parameter by K-means clustering algorithm. Further, a cluster with less than specified number of features is considered as a sparse cluster and which have more than specified number features as a dense cluster. The member of sparse cluster are forcibly assigned to nearest dense cluster and this procedure is repeated until all sparse clusters are not merged to any dense cluster. Further, the ratio between inter class correlation and intra class correlation inside a cluster elements is calculated and is considered as final ratio. The features within a cluster having ratio between inter and intra class correlation coefficient nearer to 1 are  considered as best features.==== RESULTSThe proposed hybrid model is experimented on three bench marked credit scoring datasets Japanese, German and Australian and comprehensive experiments are conducted to show the relative performances. According to results obtained from proposed approach with Japanese and German datasets have the lowest number of features whereas Australian dataset has second lowest number of features as compared to other discussed approaches. Further, classification results with PS outperformed other techniques in finding the feature selection problem in terms of classification accuracy and F1-score. In case of weighted voting results with PS also outperformed as compared to conventional features selection techniques and results with all features.==== COMMENTSThe experiment has been started and conducted well (datasets from 3 different countries),whereas I could not find the limitations or improvement areas found during the experiment and different procedures followed in this paper. A clarity on the rightness of the model on the data would give us an idea about how to improve or to use the model in the real world.
