== AGENT

A team of researchers working at the Francis Crick Institute in the UK

== GOAL

They are trying to use machine learning to find mutations in similar 
genome sequences of cancer samples

== DATA

TThe researchers first started looking for mutations in non unique parts of the genome.
They then used an alogorithm to spot mutations in different tissues, from 2658 different 
samples from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genome dataset.

== METHODS

The methods involved first creating a list of all the genome regions known to be similar 
to other regions and using them to teach a machine learning algorithm how to recognize them.

== RESULTS

The researchers discovered mutations in 1,744 coding sequences with thousands of other
ones in non- coding sequences. The also realised that they had a false discovery rate of 7%
and an accurate validation rate of more than 80%

They also found out that the mutations involved in the coding sequence had an impact on 
protein sequences, which have been linked to cancer types, they found a recurrent mutation in 
KMT3C and PIK3CA genes and also mutations that have been previously linked to breast cancer.

They also found mutatins that have involvment in regulatory regions along with some in
the immunoglobulin family

== ISSUES

My only worry would with this work would be the reliabilty on their results, it would be very
concerning for them to find something that seems like it one thing but is actuall completely 
different, which could be very serious in a situation like this.

== SCORE

3

== COMMENTS

This article was okay, it did not seem as if there had been anything groundbreaking done. I would
think that with all the years of cancer research there would be something that has happened recently
that would be more interesting than this.
