==== GOAL

The paper looks to identify phishing strategies used by fraudsters and use 
machine learning techniques to automatically classify emails as phished or ham.

==== DATA

The dataset was self made where 9 features were extracted from both the
ham and phished emails. One feature include whether there was presence
of javascript in an email, if the <script> tag was present these were 
considered to be a phished email, the same was considered for the <form> tag.
Another was the presence of 'action' words such as PayPal or bank, here the 
sender pretends to be apart of an organization, these were binary features.

==== METHODS

The features described in the data section above are fed into SVM, Naive Bayes, 
Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Voted Perception classification models.
They used 10-fold cross validation which splits up the data 10 times randomly 
into training and test sets and averages are taken for the correctly predicted.

==== RESULTS

The accuracy results the SVM, Random Forest, Logistic and Naive Bayes were all
greater than 99%.

==== COMMENTS

This dataset may not represent a real life scenario as fraudsters are constantly
increasing their phishing strategies. Adding a variety of emails for both ham 
and phished the system would be closer to a real life scenario.
