== GOAL

Role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in real estate sector; advantages over Robotic Process Automation algorithms.

== DATA

CRE innovation report 2020

== METHODS

AI & ML algorithms (predictive analysis algorithm).

== RESULTS

RPA  (Robotic Process Automation) uses structured inputs and logic, while AI uses unstructured inputs and develops its own logic.

== ISSUES

A research based on determinig how AI and ML is better than RPA and hence demerits of RPA have been showcased in this article.

== COMMENTS

I found it really cool as this gives a new dimesnion to real estate business. PropTech firms are using such algorithms to supplement the investments team to optimize their time allocation and increase their conversion ratio.The adoption of AI will positively impact efficiency, costs of management, transparency, and most importantly, assessment of assets. Certainly, artificial intelligence revolution has arrived and it is here to stay.
