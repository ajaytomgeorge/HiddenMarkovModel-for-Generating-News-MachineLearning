==== AGENT

Rochester Institute of Technology and Duke University.

==== GOAL

They are exploring whether that Achilles' heel could also protect your information. 

==== DATA

Reviews in the Google Play store which included a person’s location 

==== METHODS

They trained a machine-learning engine with that data set to try to predict the home city of users based only on their app ratings. 
They then tried to break the engine by using adversarial examples.

==== RESULTS

They found that based on Google Play likes alone, some machine-learning techniques could guess a user's city on the first try with up to 44 percent accuracy. They also found that by adding just three fake app ratings that the engines prediction was no better than a random guess. One of the researchers stated that "With just a few changes, we could perturb a user’s profile so that an attacker’s accuracy is reduced back to that baseline," .


==== COMMENTS

The article also talks about another research group which has experimented with a form of adversarial example data protection that's intended to cut short that cat-and-mouse game. The researchers found that the fingerprinting technique could identify a website among a collection of 95 possibilities with up to 95 percent accuracy. In light of the Cambridge Analytical scandal , it is interesting to see how the  method's can be used for good.
