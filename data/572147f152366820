==== AGENT ====

 collaboration between software engineers from Google AI and Who did the machine learning? (E.g., Google Brain, Prof Jane Baz’s group
at University of North Hoople, etc.)



==== GOAL ==== Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography has been shown to reduce mortality by 20–43%. We propose a deep learning algorithm that uses a patient’s current and prior computed tomography volumes to predict the risk of lung cancer. 

What were they trying to do?



==== DATA

 ==== their data was taken from 6716 National Lung Cancer Screening Trial cases, and also on a set of independent 1139 clinical trial cases.Where did they get their data? What did it look like?



==== METHODS ==== To see whether artificial intelligence could augment radiologists’ accuracy in analyzing CT scans, the research team fed thousands of scans from the earlier NIH study into Google’s computers, along with the patients’ later diagnoses. After this training, the researchers tested the model’s accuracy in detecting cancer from new scans and compared it to that of six radiologistsWhat did they actually do?



==== RESULTS

 ==== Where more than one scan had been taken of a person over time, the model performed as well as the radiologists, but when just one image was available, the program yielded 5 percent fewer false negatives and 11 percent fewer false positives than the physicians How did it go for them?



==== COMMENTS

 ==== Its clear that this type of analysis is very benificial in helping the diagnoses in lung cancer in oposite. The fact that they compared ~7000 data sets to only 6 radiologists is poor. They should increaase the number to make it more accurate. Your own personal comments and thoughts etc.
Include things about the deficiency of the story as written if you’re feeling snarky.
