== AGENT

Researchers at MIT

== GOAL

Train a robot arm to locate and retrieve items, even when they are buried under a pile

== DATA

Visual data from a camera and radio frequency (RF) information from an antenna 

== METHODS

RL

== RESULTS

Quite successful - RFusion had a 96 percent success rate when retrieving objects that were fully hidden under a pile.

== ISSUES

If the technology was to be used in an industrial/domestic setting, as suggested in the article, it would need to undergo measures that ensure the safety of humans around it.

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

The wide range of potential applications for this robot arm makes it an exciting achievement.
