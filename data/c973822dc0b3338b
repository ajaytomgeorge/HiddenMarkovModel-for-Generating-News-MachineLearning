==== AGENT

Apple

==== GOAL

The goal was to make improvements to siri. Siri would be able to understand the tone of your voice, through this it 
would better clssify the question you are asking, thus giving a better response.

==== DATA

The article doesn't explicitly say, however one can assume it is the same data they used to train siri in the first 
place.

==== METHODS
Siri is trained using speech recognition and language processing. The article doesn't say what thechniques were used to
build on the already existing system.

==== RESULTS

The results have yet to be seen as it will only be showcased this week. There is no release date for when consumers
will get the use of the product.

==== COMMENTS

The article gave very little detail about the actual algorithm. As much as this is a breakthrough for siri and it's 
competitors, they still haven't addressed a basic problem. Siri is basically a lambda function. You use it once and 
it's forgotten. Yuo can ask a question and then refer back to that question. Threating each question unique and having 
it's own lambda function for it saves a lot on resources, but it also makes me never use such features. I'm usually 
faster doing it with my own hands.
