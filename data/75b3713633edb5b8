==== AGENT

A program called MesoNet, developed by various resreachers. 

==== GOAL

The goal was to accurately predict the overall survival of mesothelioma patients from whole-slide digitized images, without any pathologist-provided locally annotated regions.

==== DATA

To train and test MesoNet, they used a dataset of 2,981 slides from 2,981 pleural mesothelioma patients from multiple French institutions (MESOPATH/MESOBANK25) and randomly 
divided it into a Train set (2,300 slides) and an entirely separate Test set (681 slides).

==== METHODS

First they detected the part of the image that contains matter. This segmentation is performed using a U-Net neural-network approach.
They divided the part of the slides for which matter is detected into smaller images, called ‘tiles’, of fixed size (224 × 224 pixels).
They used a netwrok that was already pre-trained for any image recognition task to obtain 2,048 relevant features from each tile.
They then used a convolutional one-dimensional (1D) layer to create a score for each tile. This convolutional layer performed a weighted sum between all 2,048 features of the tile to obtain this score.
The last step consisted of a Multi-layer perceptron with two fully connected layers of 200 and 100 neurons with sigmoid activation. This is the core of the predictive algorithm.
==== RESULTS

The machine learning tool did not just accurately predict mesothelioma survival. It also revealed the basis for those predictions. 
It turns out that mesothelioma survival may have more to do with things like cellular diversity, inflammation, and vacuolization that doctors thought.

Machine Learning in this case could help save lives.
