==== AGENT

Brad Coffey, Chief Strategy Officer at Hubspot.
Vedant Misra, Founder & CEO at Kemvi.

==== GOAL

Hubspot are currently trying to use Kemvi's machine learning technology to identify
triggering events in companies such as changes in structure or management. This 
would allow hubspot to converse with prospective clients and serve existing customers 
in a more effective manner.

==== DATA

Kemvi recently developed a product called DeepGraph that analyzis public data. Hubspot
aquired Kemvi so that they could use the DeepGraph to they're advantage.

==== METHODS

The analyzed data collected from the deepGraph will allow the Hubspot sals team to identify
the best time to reach out to potential customers and existing customers.

==== RESULTS

The project is still currently in progress. Hubspot has aquired Kemvi and the two companies 
are currently working together with high ambition.

==== COMMENTS

Little is known about the current status of the project. With the right team and dedication,
I feel that this is something that could stand out in sales marketing as a real advantage over 
competitive companies and a great way to introduce machine learning into a company.
