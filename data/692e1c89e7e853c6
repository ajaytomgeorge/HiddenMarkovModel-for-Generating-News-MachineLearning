==== AGENT

Who did the machine learning? 

Microsoft China

==== GOAL

What were they trying to do?

They wanted to develop an algorithm that reads and digests news articles and 
is capable of commenting on this article with humans. They call it DeepCom, 
short for Deep Commenter.

==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?

They used two datasets, a Chinese dataset made by crawling 
Tencent News, a Chinese website of news and personal opinion articles, 
and an English dataset built by crawling news articles and comments from Yahoo News.

==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

They used two neural networks, a reading network that can comprehend
an article and extracts important points, and a generation network that writes a
comment based on those points and the title of the article. This is in an attempt 
to mirror the way humans consume knowledge online.


==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?

The team were successful in the fact that the project works successfully
but something like this is too dangerous to be released to the public. 
They tested it on the Fifa world rankings and the machine commented
"If itâ€™s heavily based on the 2018 WC, hence England leaping up the rankings, 
how are Brazil at 3?" and "England above Spain, Portugal and Germany. Interesting."


==== COMMENTS

Your own personal comments and thoughts etc.

DeepCom is a great experiment as to what machine learning is capable of and 
demonstrates how human-like these machines are becoming in the sense that they can think
the same way a human does. This algorithm is too dangerous to be released to the public
just yet as it would need some sort of filter to prevent it from learning unfriendly behaviour.
