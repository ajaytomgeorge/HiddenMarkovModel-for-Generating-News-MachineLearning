Neuroscientist Carlos Ponce of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis

==== GOAL

The goal of the project was to analyse the activity of the brain when a monkey observes different images and to
generate an image that would stimulate a certain are of the brain the most. 

==== DATA

The data used to train the machine was data from the monkey’s brains, this data being how stimulated the inferior temporal cortices of the 
brain was.

==== METHODS

Six monkeys were connected to the machine by their inferior temporal cortices and then placed Infront of a screen where forty randomly computer-generated images
where displayed. the computer analysed which top ten pictures stimulated the monkeys brain cells the most and then rearranged them into a different pixel arrangement and 
then shown to the monkeys again with the original ten photos. This procedure was repeated two hundred and fifty times between time lengths of one to three hours,
until the monkey wouldn’t look at the pictures anymore.

==== RESULTS

The results showed an image that was generated by the computer but using the monkey’s brain to basically guide the pixels into place. The resulting
images slightly resembled other monkeys faces or even the faces of their handlers.

==== COMMENTS

From reading this article it shows that machine learning is helping discover new unknows about the brain and how individual sections of the 
brain maybe stimulated. if this were to keep on advancing in the future there may be a possibility of finding away so enhance the brains functionality 
i.e. simulate certain parts of the brain to help with concentration or creativity.
