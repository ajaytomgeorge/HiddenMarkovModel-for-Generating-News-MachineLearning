To improve the accuracy of their ads and increase the number of users who buy because of ads

== DATA

Collected data from users with emphasis on their shopping and media consumption

== METHODS

Advanced Machine Learning. The explanation makes it sound like regression

== RESULTS

Increased the number of customers per ad while respecting privacy laws

== ISSUES

Main issue I see is the tracking. Privacy laws are always behind what tech companies are doing. I feel on an ethical level this could negatively impact those with a lower amount of disposable income or those who are susceptible to impulse purchases.

== COMMENTS

It's interesting to see how companies are constantly finding loopholes to keep harvesting user data in the interest of "improving" their online experience. It was also a nice look at how advertising works in the digital age. Reporting was okay, I feel that it was written for people with a good understanding of marketing, but not technology. I read some of the doc google has on the DDA and the article was almost a cut and paste of that. I think it was a new method for a task that already has a solution. I think it will be intersting to see how long this lasts before a new privacy law is introduced forcing changes.
