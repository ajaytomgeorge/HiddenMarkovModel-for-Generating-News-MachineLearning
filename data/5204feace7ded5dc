 Xiangrui Meng (Databricks enterprise) and Ameet Talwalkar (UCLA) 


==== GOAL They are trying to get rid of the pressing need to develop solutions to harness a wealth of data using statistical methods. 

==== DATA The data is open-source 


==== METHODS They had implemented MLlib, Spark’s distributed machine learning library, which is the largest such library 


==== RESULTS

 They implemented this large library using Apache Spark because it is efficient at iterative computations and is thus well-suited for the development of large-scale machine learning applications 


==== COMMENTS

 I think this is a great achievement because it provides distributed implementations of common learning algorithms and optimizes to be more efficient among other things.

==== AGENT

 Google Brain 


==== GOAL They wanted to implement a system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments 


==== DATA Tensor-flow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state 


==== METHODS

 TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms and supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks 


==== RESULTS It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs

Article 3
==== SOURCE

==== AGENT

 Some professors of the department of Statistics (University of Muchich) 


==== GOAL

 They are trying to implement a standarized interface for R (a very popular and widely-used software system of statistics)


==== DATA They use R
==== METHODS

 They implemented a MLR package, which provides a unified interface to machine learning inR

==== RESULTS Defining learning tasks, training models, mak-ing predictions, and evaluating their performance abstracts from the implementation of theunderlying learner through an object-oriented interface.  Replacing one learning algorithmwith another becomes as easy as changing a string

==== COMMENTS I think it's not that useful
