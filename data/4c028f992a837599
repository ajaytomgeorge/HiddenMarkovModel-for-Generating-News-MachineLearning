==== GOAL

Use machine learning to improve subseasonal climate forecasting.

==== DATA

Meteorological records.

==== METHODS

Trained a system that combines historical weather-pattern recognition with modern machine learning techniques to produce real-time predictions of temperature and precipitation anomalies two to six weeks in advance for the western United States.

==== RESULTS

They won first place in three out of four temperature forecasting categories in the Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo competition.

==== COMMENTS

Model seems to have been a success but the article is a bit light on what data they used.
