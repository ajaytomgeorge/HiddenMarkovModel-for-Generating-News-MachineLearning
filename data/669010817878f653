==== GOAL

They were attempting to come up with a more accurate estimate of oceanic methane emissions.

==== DATA

The data came from a database of CH4 concentration measurements from the ocean mixed layer, to form the basis of a CH4 climatology that was used train the machine-learning models.
The majority of [CH4] data were taken from the Marine Methane and Nitrous Oxide (MEMENTO) Database.

==== METHODS

For each month, all data collected during that month (regardless of year) was pinned onto a 0.25° × 0.25° latitude/longitude grid, and the average value for each grid cell was calculated.
The monthly CH4 climatology was used to train an ensemble of ANN and RRF models to generate continuous, mapped climatologies.

==== RESULTS

"Our approach allowed us to pin down the global ocean emission rate much more accurately than ever before"
Very shallow coastal waters contribute around 50 percent of the total methane emissions from the ocean, despite making up only 5 percent of the ocean area.
Methane exhibits a spatial pattern very similar to that of phytoplankton abundance, which supports a controversial recent hypothesis that plankton produces methane in the surface ocean.

This is a very important use of ML at the moment, with the issue of climate change becoming more worrying by the day.
