==== AGENT

Spotify

==== GOAL

Create weekly playlists for its users based on what the users have been listening to recently.

==== DATA

They gather their data from users of their service based on how much they stream songs on the service.

==== METHODS

They use 3 methods to generate the most accurate recommendations for the users:
1. Collaborative filtering
	By assigning a song to have data based on users that have listened to it and other songs that they 
	have listened to. By finding the most played songs by similar users Spotify can recommend them if 
	this user has not listened to it themselves.
	
2. Natural language processing
	Spotify looks all over the web for numerous mentions of songs and adjectives associated with songs 
	in their library and stores the data based on these findings under the songs. It then uses a 
	weight filter to determine if two songs are similar and reccomentds based on that.
	
3. Audio models
	By using convolutional neural networks, Spotify is able to generate an understanding for new songs 
	released as to the nature of them. Be it tempo, acoustic nature, danceability etc. and compares it 
	to other songs listened to by the numerous users of the platform.

==== RESULTS

Every week each user gets a new selection of 30 songs picked to suit their taste in music.

==== COMMENTS

I think this article explains the numerous methods of Spotify's machine learning algorithm clearly and
in an interesting way that makes for an enjoyable read.
