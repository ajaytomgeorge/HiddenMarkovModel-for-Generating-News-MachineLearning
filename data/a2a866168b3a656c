==== AGENT

Researchers at MIT and the University of California at San Diego

==== GOAL

The goal of the project was to use machine learning to help prevent and catch IP hijacker.  

==== DATA

The data used to teach the machine was data from years of operators mailing lists and past Border gateway patrol data,
which gets collected globally every five minutes.

==== METHODS

From all this data they gathered they taught the machine how to predict which IP addresses belonged to mischievous actors by analysing
individual qualities of past actors. these consisted of qualities such as the blocks of the IP Address changing more rapidly than the average 
users IP blocks, having numerous IP blocks and having IP Address that spread throughout multiple countries in order to help hide their real IP address.  

==== RESULTS

The project was a success in the fact that the machine was able to identify mischievous actors but for twenty percent of all the identities made, there was a false positive.
For these cases the researchers had to manually engage the machine to find out if it was a legitimate user or a malicious one.

==== COMMENTS

Since people are using the internet more and more for transactions and the option of saving credit card details to your PC is become more frequently used.
i feel that this influences hijackers to not only continue at the rate at which they hack people’s machines but also grow because the potential rewards for the hackers
are growing. I think there should be a lot more projects looking into ways of how to protect peoples PC's as many people don’t fully understand how they work it is important 
for them to feel that they can use their PC in a secured manner.
