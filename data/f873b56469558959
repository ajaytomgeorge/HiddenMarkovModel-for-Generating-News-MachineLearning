== GOAL
To create a computer that could play the board game GO at a high level

== DATA
The data was gotten from millions of previously GO matches by humans

Deep learning -> a subset of supervised learning

== RESULTS
The AlphaGo project was very successful and was able to beat the world champion easily and has been said to make moves that are futuristic to human players

It has beaten all the best humans in the GO field, so it has no more competition to test how good it has become.

== COMMENTS
I think it is a very interesting because GO is a very hard game and for an application to solve it so effectively is very fascinating to me.
