==== AGENT

Deepfake creator Sham00k.

==== GOAL

The goal was to create a video transforming an impressionist into different celebrities by using Deepfake methods to change their face.

==== DATA

The dataset consisted of 1,200 hours of video and 300,000 images of 20 celebrities. The project took close to one terabyte of data to create.

==== METHODS

DeepFaceLab open-source software was used to create the video.

==== RESULTS

The result was a 2 and a half minute long video of impressionist Jim Meskimen going through 20 impressions while his face changes for each impression to realistically  match the celebrity.

==== COMMENTS

The video poses questions for both the tech industry and governments about how legal or ethical Deepfakes are as they get more and more realistic.
