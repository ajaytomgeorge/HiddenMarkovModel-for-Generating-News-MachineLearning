==== AGENT 

Googles AI

==== GOAL

To see whether artificial intelligence could improve radiologist's accuracy in analysing CT scans


==== DATA

They used data from an earlier NIH study.

==== METHODS

The research team fed thousands of scans from the earlier NIH study into Google’s computers as well as the patient's later diagnoses. 
After this training, the researchers tested the model’s accuracy in detecting cancer from new scans and compared it to that of six radiologists. 

==== RESULTS

 The model performed as well as the radiologists when there was more than one scan was taking of the patient. However when just one image was available, the program yielded 5 percent fewer false negatives and 11 percent fewer false positives than the radiologists.
This collaboration between software engineers and clinical researchers has produced an artificial intelligence program that uses images to predict with 94 percent accuracy which people will develop lung cancer.

==== COMMENTS

The article stated that there will need to be more trails before it can be used clinically .
