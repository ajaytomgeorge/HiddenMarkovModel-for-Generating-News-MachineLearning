=== AGENT
Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) at Johns Hopkins University

==== DATA
A database of over 800,000 toxilogical studies on more than 10,000 chemicals registered under
the European REACH legislation for industrial chemicals

==== GOAL
To gain the research of animal testing by using machine learning without actually testing on animals

==== METHOD
The software takes the chemicals and uses the research based on them to predict what the results of the research
will be for chemicals that are testsed using a machine learning system.

==== RESULTS
Some chemicals were already drastically tested and were causing animal fatality, using the data meant that the same
results could be achieved without actually putting the chemical top test. It was found that 69 substances were tested
more than 45 times in the same eye test, the use of AI reduced this to 0.
