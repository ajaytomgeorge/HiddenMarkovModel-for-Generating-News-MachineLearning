== AGENT

Ducati and Accenture

== GOAL

Create more efficient, safe, and effective motorcycles

== DATA

4,000 sectors of race track and 30 scenarios along with engine parameters, speed, revs, 
tires and brake temperatures

== METHODS

Supervised learning

== RESULTS

"Simulating and monitoring a motorbike’s performance under a vast array of track and weather conditions,
they’ve been able to apply machine learning integrated with IoT sensor data, to help minimize the time, 
expense and effort of traditional on-track testing"

== ISSUES

None

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

Very interested if this technology will be applied to other bikes besides racing. It could potentially lower 
the risk of general use motorcycles.
