==== AGENT

"DeepCom" by Beihang University and Microsoft China.

==== GOAL

To write an AI which reads online news articles then posts comments in the
comments section. I don't know why, and the writer of the article doesn't seem
to either, hence the "for some reason".

The system is based on how humans "consume" their news: Read the headline, take
away a few key points then write a comment.

==== DATA

The input data consisted of 152, 355 Yahoo! news articles from a wide variety of
categories such as sports, finance, entertainment, etc, and 191, 502 Tencent
news articles (Chinese).

==== METHODS

This system uses two ANNs: A reading network, which reads the article and a
generation network which generates the comment.

The reading network reads the title and the body separately, then fuses them
into one internal representation. The output from the reading network are
"Salient spans" from the article; these are points the ANN perceives to be the
important points.

These are then fed into the comment generation network along with the article's
title to generate the comment.

==== RESULTS

This seems to be a purely academic exercise, so I'll judge it in those terms. In
the paper they provide some examples of comments produced by DeepCom and two
similar systems: Att-TC and IR-TC and claim that comments from DeepCom are more
relevant to the news articles, and they seem to be correct based on these two
cherry-picked examples.

I'm not sure what the ultimate goal of this research is though. If they wanted
to produce a nice paper, they've succeeded.

==== COMMENTS

An interesting project, and they've released the source code and explained
everything very well in the paper, so kudos to this team for doing that.

I don't really see the point of this project, other than satisfying curiosity.
If anything, this project is likely to end up doing more harm than good, as
they've released the source code so it should be pretty easy for somebody to
craft a spam bot.
