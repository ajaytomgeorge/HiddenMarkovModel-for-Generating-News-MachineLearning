== GOAL

Speed up Matrix Multiplication by a new estimation method (Multiply-ADDitioN-lESS (MADDNESS)).

== DATA

The hash functions convert input data into an index into a lookup database with pre-calculated dot-products.

== METHODS

While most AMM algorithems use multiply-add operation, MADDNESS employs a collection of highly efficient learning hash functions to attain coding rates of 100GB/second with just one CPU thread.
The hash functions convert input data into an index into a lookup database with pre-calculated dot-products.
MADDNESS is based on the Product Quantization (PQ) algorithm. PQ analyses a vast number of input vectors to generate a limited number of prototype vectors. Each prototype vector’s products with the fixed weight vector are computed in advance. Then, using a hash function, any new input vector is mapped to its most comparable prototype. This provides an index to the pre-computed product.

== RESULTS

MADDNESS runs 10x quicker than other approximation algorithms and 100x faster than accurate multiplication.
It has been made open-source.

== ISSUES

Researches mention that MADDNESS introduces some output error, but they also show that the error has a theoretical upper bound that can be paid off against speed. This still implies that there are some scenarios where this algorithm cannot be used.
MADDNESS also makes some assumptions on data - such as the matrices are "large, somewhat dense, and resident in a single computerâ's memory.".
In summary, MADDNESS is not a solution to all matrix multiplication estimations uses.

== COMMENTS

This research has one very important implication - because it is very efficient (10x faster than other approximation algorithms) and is open source, it can aid in the development of the entire field.
Many, if not the vast majority, of researchers aren't funded enough to purchase several high-grade GPUs on a regular basis, therefore MADDNESS will likely be central in solving many researches in the future.
