== GOAL
How ML can assist in archeology

== DATA
Data from archeological sites and structures

== METHODS
ML was used to analyse the data and find promising data and trim out the fat. The team used a public smaller data set and then used a deep learning process to recognise the algorithms and find specific data they needed, they then manually went over the data the algorithm found and located the known information.

== RESULTS
The results were very promising which led to a public and commercially available geographic information system ArcGis.

== ISSUES
No particular issues found! Very clear and concise article explaining the process in which ml was used and the area it was used in!

== SCORE
9
== COMMENTS
This article is an example of an article with a not particularly interesting topic to most but finding a way to make it interesting! Amazing article which kept me interested in reading throughout the whole thing! An area I didn't particularly find interesting (Archeology) unexpectedly made me very interested in it due to the writing, the concise and clear delivery of information, and the title.
