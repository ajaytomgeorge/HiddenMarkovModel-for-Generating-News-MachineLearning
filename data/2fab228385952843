==== GOAL

To use an Machine Learning Technique to predict the level of pain a patient is under when they are in an 
unconscious state, if they are incapable of communicating or during surgery. A functional near infrared 
spectroscopy neuroimaging technique (fNIRS) is used to measure neuron activity in the brain, specifically
from the prefrontal cortex. These images can then be feed into the Machine Learning Technique from test 
subjects who have scored the level of pain they are under; with the aim of predicting pain levels for those
who cannot communicate the pain they are experiencing.

==== DATA

The Data set was collected from 43 male participants who wore the fNIRS device and they were exposed to two pain
intensities of 3/10 and 7/10. Participants were then asked to score the pain they experienced on a scale
of 1 to 10.

The fNIRS then measured the amount of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin as well as the speed at which
the oxygenated hemoglobin rose.

==== METHODS

The article does not go into detail on the specific model used* but the article does describe the behaviour of
the model. 

The model is designed to not only train for target feature classification but finds shared characteristics 
among sub-populations of the data set. These sub-models are capable of running in parallel with the main model, 
referred to as the traditional model and were capable of uncovering trends, for example if older and younger 
patents have differing pain thresholds.

Learning patterns of the sub-models were shared among the entire population allowing for both fine detail 
personalized analysis of pain and for more general population level information.

==== RESULTS

A random selection of the participants were used for testing but the specific sample size was not referenced.
From the random selection the pain scores were known.

The sub-models out performed the traditional model by roughly 20%, reaching 87% accuracy in classifying patients 
with pain or no-pain.

The sample size of 43 patients was quite low but the article also references that the researchers plan to
to collect more data in the future from more diverse populations including, female patients and patients undergoing 
surgery while conscious, in order to better ascertain how accurate their model is.

==== COMMENTS

The paper for this has not yet been published but similar papers are available from the same group of
researchers:

from Physiological Signals. 2017. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.08755.pdf

*From the description of the model used in the news article and based on previous methods employed by the same 
researchers it seems that a Multi-Task Neural Network (MTNN) was incorporated in this research. MTNN work by 
sharing information between related tasks in order to better generalize a primary task. I did not include information
on this in the Methods section as this would need to be verified.
