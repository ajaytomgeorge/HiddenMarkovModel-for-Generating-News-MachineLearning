== GOAL

To classify the attitude of a journalist as ‘for’, ‘against’, or ‘neutral’ towards the person, place or thing they are writing about.

== DATA

online news stories and social media posts.

== METHODS

They used a hybrid of both called semi-supervised learning. They had tens of thousands of clearly annotated examples 
but then they got hundreds of thousands of additional reviews from various websites and those reviews will have star ratings, 
for example a review alongside three out of five stars, that act as weak supervision.

== RESULTS

They met there goal and there feature could successfully classify the attitude of a journalist 
as ‘for’, ‘against’, or ‘neutral’ towards the person, place or thing they are writing about.

== ISSUES

There could definitely be some ethical issues with this as seen before with The Cambridge Analytica scandal which has alerted us to the value 
of the information we post on social media platforms and what can happen when that information is abused. 

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I found this very interesting as I remember the cambridge analytical scandal and always wondered if anyone else was using this kind of technology 
for good uses rather than bad. The article was quite intresting and had a lot of information on it however it had no link to any paper or any firther reading
on the specific topic other than a link to the company who created it which was quite dissappointing.
