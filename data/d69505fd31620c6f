== AGENT

Nature Communications.

== GOAL

Locate genes that cause plants to grow more with less fertiliser.

== DATA

Genomic data from plants and animals.

== METHODS

Evolutionary algorithms

== RESULTS

They discovered that genes that remained constant across different species due to evolution were key factors
in determining the optimal use of nitrogen for growth. They also discovered disease outcomes in animals through studying mouse models.

== ISSUES

I dont see any glaring issues, I would have liked the algorithm to be specified a bit further.

== SCORE

7
== COMMENTS

It is a very intersting application of machine learning with very illuminating consequential effects.
I believe there will be a lot more discoveries to be made in this niche area.
