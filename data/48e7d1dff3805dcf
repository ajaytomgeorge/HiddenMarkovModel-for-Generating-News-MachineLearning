==== AGENT

Beihang University / Microsoft China

==== GOAL

To create a bot that will read and comment on online news articles, in order to encourage user engagement.

==== DATA

Two datasets were used - one Chinese and one English. They were created by crawling news articles and comments from Yahoo! News.
In particular the title and different key points were of interest.

==== METHODS

The system is made of two neural networks: a reading network that 'comprehends' articles and picks important points,
and a generation network that writes comments based on the points and the title of the article.
Both models are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) ie. outputs are also used in training.


==== RESULTS

Experimental results on two public data sets indicate that the proposed model can significantly outperform baseline methods,
in terms of both automatic evaluation and human evaluation

==== COMMENTS

Most people consider bot accounts and fake content to be problematic, though admittedly this is a creative use of ML
