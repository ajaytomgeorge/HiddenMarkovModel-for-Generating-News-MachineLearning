==== AGENT

Tesla path planning

==== GOAL

The goal is to teach a machine to drive like a human. It involves teaching it to stay in its lane, keep the speed limit, change lanes, take turns and watch out for pedestrians.

==== DATA

They collect data from all of its users and vehicles. Tesla vehicles have multiple sensors
that collects various data.

==== METHODS

Use imitation learning to predict what a human driver would do by finding connections between what it sees and human behaviour.

==== RESULTS

Tesla is currently applying imitation learning to driving tasks and plans to use it for other tasks.

==== COMMENTS

This could reduce human errors and car accidents.
