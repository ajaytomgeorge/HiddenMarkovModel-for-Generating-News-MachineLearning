== AGENT
Karajan Institute in partnership with Playform.
== GOAL
Use Machine Learning techniques to complete Beethoven's Tenth Symphony.
== DATA
Several of Beethoven's previous musical sketches, Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in particular. 
== METHODS
While the method they used wasn't mentioned in the article, after some research, I found that Supervised Learning (Deep Learning) approaches 
can be used for audio processing.
== RESULTS
After spending 2 years training their Machine Learning model, they were able to play the completed Symphony produced by their model to some 
journalists. The journalists could not pick out the parts of the symphony that were constructed by their model. Only people who had a vast 
knowledge of Beethovens's work could tell the difference.
== ISSUES
The Tenth Symphony that they created hasn't actually been released yet, so it is hard to say how good the final Symphony actually is.
== SCORE
9
== COMMENTS
I found this very topic very interesting and it shows how powerful well-trained Machine Learning models can be. The one thing I will say is that 
the article didn't really go into any technical detail on the methods used to create the model.
