== AGENT

MIT

== GOAL

Find new antibiotic strains.

== DATA

Chemical compounds, presumably from already existing data. The article says that 100 million compounds could be screened in days.

== METHODS

Deep neural network

== RESULTS

A molecule called halicin was found to be effective against some bacterial strains.

== ISSUES

It's not clear but I do wonder how many false positives that failed at the level of animal trials due to causing side effects.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

The reporting in the press was fairly simplistic and didn't go into significant detail. I had to go to the paper itself to find any indication of how it was carried out. 
I've always disliked that often articles that talk about papers don't actually link to them or at least provide the name of the paper.
