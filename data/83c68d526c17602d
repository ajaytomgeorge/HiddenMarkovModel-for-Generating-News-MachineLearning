== AGENT
Robin Ducot, Silicon Republic, Survey Monkey

== GOAL
To show how ML can help with data insights such as surveys.

== DATA
Large volumes of feedback from many projects

== METHODS
Using this data, they used ML practices to derive deeper insights ( not specified) 

== RESULTS
According to the article they reached this deep level of insight which helped them help more of their users.

== ISSUES
Again similar to the other articles they didn't go into specific detail as to what ML practices they use, it was in an interview style as well, which personally I don't like. And the article itself never answered the question directly it just repeated what it said, which didn't allow me to get much info from it/

== SCORE
3

== COMMENTS
Wasn't a particularly interesting article, the topic itself was but it never went into detail as described and the interview style article personally are not very good in general.
