==Goal
Creating a model to detect Skin Cancer.

==Data
They created a dataset of 116 images of these rare cancers and of the benign lesions seborrheic keratosis and hemangiomas
and assessed these images with two machine-learning models.

==Methods
Supervised Learning

==Results
Model incorrectly classifies rare, aggressive skin cancers

==Issues
The high false-positive rate of Model 1 has potentially negative consequences on a personal and societal level. 

==Score
4

==Comments
interesting new way of using existing data and methods, but they had failed to analyze and do not make 
systematic analysis of all the skin's surface.
