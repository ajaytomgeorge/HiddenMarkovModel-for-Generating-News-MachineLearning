== GOAL

Leveraging Machine learning to optimise CO2 Absorption.

== DATA

CO2 gas emitted from large point sources (e.g., power plants, cement industries)

== METHODS

Predictive Analytics

== RESULTS

 CO2 adsorption using solid porous carbon materials.

== ISSUES

This can somewhat less the impact of climate change, but I feel it is not that cost effective.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

With climate change being the recent headlines , we need to act quickly so that our future generation gets what we had. This can also help the industries plan the emission of gases properly and thus helping our nature.
