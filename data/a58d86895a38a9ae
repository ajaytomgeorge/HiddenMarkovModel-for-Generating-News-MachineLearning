== AGENT

Childrenâ€™s National Hospital researchers

== GOAL

A system that could identify genetic syndromes in children through rapid screening

== DATA

System trained on data from 2800 pediatric patients from 28 countries.

== METHODS

They used Deep Learning technology to train the network

== RESULTS

The system can indicate the presence of genetic syndrome from a facial photograph

== ISSUES

Because the images of of different patients from around the world there may be issue or lack of training of the
network of people of various ethnicities. The images would also need to be stored securely to maintain the privacy
of the patients

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

This network can be very useful for various patients that don't have access to the facilities that they may need.
The system also shows the potential that Machine Learning and Deep Learning has and what it could bring to the 
medical field.
