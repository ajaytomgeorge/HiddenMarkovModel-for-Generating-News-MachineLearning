== AGENT

Kylie Foy, MIT Lincoln Laboratory

== GOAL

To build an algorithm that automatically schedules aircrew for US Air Force."Being a scheduler is an additional duty on top of an airman's main job, such as being a pilot"

== DATA

Probably the data would have consisted of aircrew and available military cargo aircrafts

== METHODS 

Reinforcement learning

== RESULTS

Successfully built a model that allows airman to chose their schedule from multiple schedule

== ISSUES

NIL

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

the Air Force letting its guard down and letting others in to help us leverage AI and machine learning to make people's lives better on a daily basis
