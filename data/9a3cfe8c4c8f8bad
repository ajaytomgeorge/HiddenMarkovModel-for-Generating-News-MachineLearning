==== AGENT

Developed by Ze Yang, Can Xu, Wei Wu, Zhoujun Li - State Key Lab of Software Development Environment, Beihang University, Beijing, China;
Microsoft Corporation, Beijing, China
They called the model "DeepCom", short for "deep commenter".

==== GOAL

To use machine learning to create a bot that reads news articles and comments on them. 

==== DATA

DeepCom is trained on two datasets: a Chinese dataset made by crawling Tencent News, a popular Chinese websites of news and opinion articles, 
and an English dataset built by crawling news articles and comments from Yahoo News.

==== METHODS

They used two networks, a reading network and a generation network. 
Aim to create a new comment based on probability distribution on actual comments on an article, and given a new article generate a new comment following this formula D={(Ti,Bi,Ci)}Ni=1, 
where the i-th triple(Ti,Bi,Ci) consists of a newstitle Ti, a news body Bi, and a comment Ci. Their goal was to estimate a probability distribution P(C|T,B) from D.

==== RESULTS

On most automatic metrics, DeepCom outperforms baseline methods, and the improvement is statistically significant. 
In human evaluation, the values of Fleissâ€™ kappa over all models are more than 0.6, indicating substantial agreement among the annotators.

==== COMMENTS

The original publication of this paper cited a use for this technology to boost engagement on
articles, as it would encourage real people to comment on the article too.
They left this statement out of the newer version, replacing it by acknowledging the risks involved
with an AI that pretends to be human commenting on news stories.
