== AGENT

Researchers at Trinity College

== GOAL

Apply machine learning techniques to analyse healthcare records and improve quality of care

== DATA

Anonymous data from ALS patients with their consent. It was gathered from groups around Europe

== METHODS

The description indicates regression machine learning.

== RESULTS

Their results will alert a doctor if the quality of life of the patient could be better.

== ISSUES

I dont see many issues with this. I feel that medical care is unique for each patient so the weighting of the data might offer poor suggestions for some patients.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Very interesting article, it seems like a great idea especially in the long run. Hopefully it will speed up the care process for patients and allow a better form of treatment for them. Article is well written. I cannot fault it. It seems to be standard techniques for machine learning. With some time and more data hopefully it will see a larger roll out. I also like that the data collection is done both anonymously and consentually.
