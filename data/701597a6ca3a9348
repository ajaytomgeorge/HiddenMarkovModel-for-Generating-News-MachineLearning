== GOAL

Realise the dangers in unmoderated data scraping

== DATA

The AI scraped stories from a platform called Choose Your Story and mimicked writing styles from the stories.

== METHODS

The AI was trained through unsupervised learning methods. It utilsed OpenAIâ€™s GPT-2 and GPT-3 models for training.

== RESULTS

While the AI was able to successfully mimick the writing style and produce an actual story, it also led to NSFW moments and characters to be introduced.

== ISSUES

While the methods used and how it learnt were fine, there was no look to what data was actually scraped. Thus, the stories had unethical NSFW moments.
There were no immediate alterations by the developers in retraining the AI, but they started to ban the users who (not always knowingly) clicked their way to these stories.
This was a shift of blame which many disputed against as they paid money for this service and were, by all means, innocent.
As the code was open source, the report was not tunnel visioned on only the bad but gave an honest overview on what the AI was scraping.

== COMMENTS

I actually found this article very interesting. It reminded me of the tank-recognition AI story mentioned in a previous lecture. It showed that even in modern times that programmers
can use problematic datasets when not scrutinised properly.
