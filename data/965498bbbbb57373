==== GOAL

Reduce Latency during Cloud Gaming

==== DATA

Data was acquired from interactive gamer testing. Data was primarily controls for a game.

==== METHODS

They used a Markov-based prediction model to forecasr expected future input from a user. The two techniques used to improve prediction quality were, supersampling of input events and cpnstructing a Kalman filter to improve users' perception of smoothness 

==== RESULTS

They found that players perceived only minor differences in responsiveness on
DeLorean (the predictive input technology) even with some network latnecy when compared
head-to-head to a system with no latency. Overall, player
surveys indicated positive reception of gameplay on DeLorean.

==== COMMENTS

The use of predictive machine learning to predict user input for gaming seems like a good idea on paper.
