== AGENT

Childern's National Hospital

== GOAL

Detect the risk of genetic syndromes in childern with diverse backgrounds

== DATA

2800 Facial photos of childern from 3 public databases, including the Atlas of Human Malformations in Diverse Populations and Face2Gene. Photos from Childern's National Hospital, Demographic data from medical records.

== METHODS

Deep Learning, Image standardisation, facial morphology detection, genetic syndrome risk estimation. Softmax

== RESULTS

Detection average accuracy of 88%.

== ISSUES

Dispite positive results, I believe that the small sample size could be limiting the accuracy of detection.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

An interesting use of Machine Learning, with a lot of potencial to help healthcare. Hopefully after this work is used, more data will be gathered to further accuracy and maybe use the techniques for similar detection tasks.
