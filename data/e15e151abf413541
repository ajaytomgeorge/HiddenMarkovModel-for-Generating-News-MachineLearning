 ==== AGENT 

MIT and IBM

==== GOAL

 To make AI accessible to anyone with a low-power device.

==== DATA

“The 20BN-SOMETHING-SOMETHING dataset is a large collection of densely-labelled video clips that show humans performing predefined basic actions with everyday objects. The dataset was created by a large number of crowd workers. It allows machine learning models to develop fine-grained understanding of basic actions that occur in the physical world.”

==== METHODS

They outline a method for shrinking video-recognition models to speed up training and improve runtime performance on smartphones and other mobile devices. This new method makes it possible to shrink the model to one-sixth the size by reducing the 150 million parameters in a state-of-the-art model to 25 million parameters. 

==== RESULTS

The model that outperformed its peers at recognizing actions in the Something-Something video dataset. 
The team trained the model in 14 minutes using a supercomputer, this would normally take two days on a machine with a one graphics processor.
