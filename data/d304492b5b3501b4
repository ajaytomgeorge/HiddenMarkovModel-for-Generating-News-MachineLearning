== GOAL

Novel data-driven framework to learn fast and dynamic interactions that involve multiple contacts.

== DATA

A large database of one-on-one basketball plays

== METHODS

Quadruped Motion Learning, Generative adversarial networks (GANs), Memory-augmented Neural Network (MANN)

== RESULTS

Introduced a novel feature called the local motion phase, which
together with their mixture-of-experts architecture can learn fast
and dynamic movements during basketball play

== ISSUES

Currently they are considering only one to one plays, these has limited effect in realistic scenario as 
basketball invovles comples relations between multiple players.
They also haven't elaborated much about their dataset

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

It was really interesting to bring a dimension of the game into the picture as it wouldn't be a normally easy.
The developed framework has so much scope of expanding into multiple interaction games.
