== AGENT

University of Glasgow

== GOAL

Predict the probability that an animal virus might jump into humans.

== DATA

They used published datasets of genomic data of viruses.

== METHODS

Supervised learning was used, presumably a neural network.

== RESULTS

The model correctly identified 70.8% of viruses with high zoonotic potential.

== ISSUES

There does not seem to be any glaring issues with their methods.

== SCORE

8
== COMMENTS

The utility of an ML application like this is quite self-explanatory, I appreciated the methodology behind
ranking several models based on accuracy on an unseen dataset. This gave more accurate predictions overall.
