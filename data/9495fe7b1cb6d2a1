==== AGENT
Researchers at MIT and the University of California. 

==== GOAL
Their goal was to develop a Machine Learning algorithm to identify suspicous networks, i.e networks that belong to IP
hijackers.
With an end goal of reducing the amount IP address hijacks, which in turn prevents theft of cryptocurrency and
distribution of spam and malware.

==== DATA
The model was trained on data representing the activity of "serial hijackers", so they could identify common features
among them.
The data was pulled from network operating mail lists, historical BGP data sampled at a rate of 5 minutes from the
global routing table.

==== METHODS
Using the data, the researchers identified the qualities associated with "malicous actors" and trained a ML model to
automatically detect these behaviors.

==== RESULTS
The ML model was able to pick up on:
Turbulant changes in activity, hacker's address blocks disapear much faster than those of 
actual networks. 
Multiple Address Blocks; hackers adveritse a significantly larger amount of network prefixes.
IPs spread accross multiple countries; the majority of legitamate networks don't have foreign
IP addresses, this is not the case with malicious netowrks, who have multiple foreign addresses spreading accross
different countries and continents.

==== COMMENTS
The article doesn't mention any details regarding what type of machine learning algorithms they used, neural nets, SVMs,
etc.
They also neglect to mention any statistics about the data, such as quantity or its type (text, numbers).
Some information about how the algorithm will be deployed would also have been nice, along with what technologies they
used (python, Tensorflow, etc)
