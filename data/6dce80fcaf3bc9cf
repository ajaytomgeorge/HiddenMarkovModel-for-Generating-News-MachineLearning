== GOAL

They tried to segment mirrors from an input image

== DATA

Mirror Segmentation Dataset, they made it themself out of pictures of mirrors

== METHODS

Deep Learning methods, contextual Contrasted Feature Extraction Method 

== RESULTS

They managed to segment mirrors from an input image

== ISSUES

The method isnâ€™t accurate and depends hardly on training dataset  .

== SCORE

9

Mirrors are everywhere in our daily lives. Existing computer vision systems do not consider mirrors, and hence may get confused by the reflected content inside a mirror, resulting in a severe performance degradation. However, separating the real content outside a mirror from the reflected content inside it is non-trivial. The key challenge is that mirrors typically reflect contents similar to their surroundings, making it very difficult to differentiate the two. In this paper, presented a novel method to segment mirrors from an input image show that it outperforms the carefully chosen baselines from the state-of-the-art detection and segmentation methods.
