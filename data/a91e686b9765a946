==== AGENT

Amazon

==== GOAL

Hire the best people ny using previous data to determine the best people to hire.

==== DATA

Th data was from succesful applicants for the last 10 years

==== METHODS

Computer models were trained to observe patterns in the CVs of hires that were succesful in the last 10 years.

==== RESULTS

Most of the succesful applicants were men, which caused the system to pick more men based on their C.V.

==== COMMENTS

This did not work because of the bias in hiring decisions that were already present. This idea was doomed to fail because it relied on previous data that was tainted.
