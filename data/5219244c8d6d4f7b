GOAL:
		Predicts the type of breast cancer, malignant or benign from the Breast Cancer data set
DATA: 
		Breast Cancer Wisconin Dataset. Dataset contains the following concepts:
		
1. Sample code number: id number 
2. Clump Thickness: 1 - 10 
3. Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10 
4. Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10 
5. Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10 
6. Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10 
7. Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10 
8. Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10 
9. Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10 
10. Mitoses: 1 - 10 
11. Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)


METHODS: 
		After some data preprocessing to extract datas that are used for the training and testing
		He was using Multi class neural networks for the prediction of type of breast cancer on other parameters, which provides high accuracy.
		
		The algorithms used were:
		1. Neural Network - Hyperparameters tuning 
		Single parameter trainer mode 
		fully connected perceptron 
		200 perceptron 
		learning rate - 0.001 
		learning iterations - 200 
		initial learning weights - 0.1 
		min-max normalizer 
		shuffled examples
		Accuracy - 0.994048
		
		2.Multi class random forest - Hyperparameter tuning 
		Single parameter training mode 
		Resampling - bagging 
		Decision trees - 15 
		Maximum depth - 32 
		Random splits per node - 128 
		Minimum samples per leaf node -1
		Accuracy - 0.988095
		
		
RESULTS: 
		By using two high accuracy algorithms, the experiment will provide a high accuracy results too.
COMMENTS:
		This experiment show how important is the maching learining, it can be used to predict diseases and might safe people's life.
