== AGENT

OpenAI Five

== GOAL

Test the progress of AI algorithms in complicated and challenging games.

== DATA

Trained 45,000 years worth of games in 10 months. They got this data by playing the bots against themselves.

== METHODS

Reinforcement Learning

== RESULTS

The neural network was able to defeat world champions in a best of three game.

== ISSUES

The AI's playing style favors short term gains over long term strategizing and planning.
There were also additional limits put in place to help the AI (the pool of available characters was reduced from 117 to 17).
The AI would likely  lose against an average player if all character combinations were available.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I thought the coverage was very good on this article, as it took time to explain both why the result was extremely impressive and also explained the shortcomings clearly and concisely.
