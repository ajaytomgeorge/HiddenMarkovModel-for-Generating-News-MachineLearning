Papadopoulos Youssef Tamaazousti Ferda Ofli Ingmar Weber Antonio Torralba Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Qatar Computing Research Institute, HBKU==== GOALIn this paper, we aim to teach a machine how to make a pizza by building a generative model that mirrors this step-by-step procedure.==== DATAThey created a synthetic dataset with clip-art-style pizza images and collected and annotated real pizza images on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)==== METHODSThe architectures of the generator modules and the discriminator are based on the ones proposed in [J.-Y. Zhu, T. Park, P. Isola, and A. A. Efros. Unpaired imageto-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks. In ICCV, 2017], as CycleGAN achieves impressive results on the unpaired image-to-image translation. The generator architecture is modified by introducing an extra convolutional layer on top of the second last layer and in parallel with the existing last one. This layer has only one output channel and they used a sigmoid activation function for the mask. For the discriminator, they adopted the popular PatchGAN architecture [P. Isola, J.-Y. Zhu, T. Zhou, and A. A. Efros. Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks. In CVPR, 2016, J.-Y. Zhu, T. Park, P. Isola, and A. A. Efros. Unpaired imageto-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks. In ICCV, 2017] that we slightly modify to also perform a multi-label classification task.==== RESULTSTheir experiments on both synthetic and real pizza images showed that the model (1)detects and segments the pizza toppings in a weakly supervised fashion without any pixel-wise supervision,  (2)fills in what has been occluded with what is underneath, and (3)infers the ordering of the toppings without any depth ordering supervision==== COMMENTSThis is an interesting idea and will defintely making pizza simpler and easier. Also, they are saying this might work with other types of food, if that is true then this is an amazing discovery.
