The dataset consists only of 2342 samples of COVID-19 cases in India from 30 January 2020 to 26 May 2020.== METHODSUsed Random Forest Model== RESULTSThis is the dataset of multi-class classification to foresee confirmed, death, and recovered/cured cases calculated through various machine learning algorithms like decision tree, multinomial logistic regression, neural network, SVM, and random forests. It was found that Random forest has the highest accuracy of 83.54%, 72.79%, and 81.27% on confirmed, death, and cured cases, respectively.== ISSUESAs there was a comparison of performance between various algorithms Random forest has the highest performance, but its accuracy could have been increased.== SCORE6== COMMENTSThis model helps the society to predict the Covid-19 pandemic. It actually helped organisations to create an awareness of the pandemic. And also people came to know the Covid-19 cases, i.e., confirmed, death, and cured cases.
