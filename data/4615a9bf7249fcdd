 Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory MIT and The Centre for Applied Internet Data Analytics

==== GOAL

The team are trying to find cybercriminals using machine learning techniques.

==== DATA

They took data from several year’s worth of network operator mailing lists and also historical BGP data taken every five minutes from the global routing table.

==== METHODS 

They observed particular qualities of malicious actors and then trained a machine-learning model to automatically identify such behaviours.
"The system flagged networks that had several key characteristics, particularly with respect to the nature of the specific blocks of IP addresses they use:

Volatile changes in activity: Hijackers’ address blocks seem to disappear much faster than those of legitimate networks. The average duration of a flagged network’s prefix was under 50 days, compared to almost two years for legitimate networks.

Multiple address blocks: Serial hijackers tend to advertise many more blocks of IP addresses, also known as “network prefixes.”

IP addresses in multiple countries: Most networks don’t have foreign IP addresses. In contrast, for the networks that serial hijackers advertised that they had, they were much more likely to be registered in different countries and continents. 
The team had to manually identify false positives as the classifier they used roughly had 20 percent of false positive cases."

==== RESULTS

The results indicated that past behaviours are clearly not being used to limit bad behaviours and prevent subsequent attacks. It looks like their method will be used in the future as cyber threats increase.
