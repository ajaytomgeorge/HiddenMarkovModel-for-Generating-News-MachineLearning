==== AGENT

AlphaGo trained by DeepMind a London based Google AI company.

==== GOAL

The goal was to train an AI to play the game of Go. 

==== DATA

The neural network analysed millions of games and then played itself across multiple computers to gain a better understanding and learn how to play a more strategic game. 

==== METHODS

They got a neural network to analyse millions of games and then the network played a number of games simultaneously across a number of computers. This taught the AI the best strategy to play the game in a method known as positive reinforcement.

==== RESULTS

It went really well for them as the AI was able to beat a professional Go player. The AI managed to win 5 out of 5 games against the European champion. 

==== COMMENTS

It worked really well for them as the AI managed to beat the European champion. From my knowledge the game of Go is a difficult game to play so training an AI to have the ability to play the game is a great accomplishment.
