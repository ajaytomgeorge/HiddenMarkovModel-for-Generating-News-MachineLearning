== AGENT

Researchers at UC Davis

== GOAL

An early detection system that uses artificial intelligence to classify admissions to rehabilitation centers, in the hope of sending wildlife agencies 
and researchers warnings about growing problems among marine birds and many other kinds of animals.

== DATA

The system scans intake reports produced at 30 California centers, listing information like the animal’s species, age, reason for admission, 
and diagnosis.The researchers used five years of data and more than 200,000 records to establish baselines for how frequently these 
conditions normally occur

== METHODS

Supervised learning. AI uses natural language processing to categorize the reports, looking for patterns in the number of admissions
related to certain illnesses and injuries.

== RESULTS

The researchers used five years of data and more than 200,000 records to establish baselines for how frequently these conditions normally occur. 
When the system detects an anomaly—an unusually high number of cases in a given species—it automatically creates an alert, 
which is delivered to wildlife experts either via the system dashboard, an email, or text message.

== ISSUES

Result may not be accurate always.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

Its interesting . But the result may not be always accurate as there could be one off diseases in this and when a new type of pattern comes system 
will have to be trained.I believe this is based on new sets of data with existing methods.More data would result in more accuracy.
