Artificially replicate humor in machines, by developing a framework that can turn existing news headlines into humorous ones.

== DATA

Humicroedit, a dataset containing over 15,000 annotated news headlines

== METHODS

long short term memory (LSTM)

== RESULTS

Human evaluators sourced online considered the headlines produced by their system funny 36% of the time

== ISSUES

It tries to find funny substitutes for some of the words in existing headlines 
and it doesn't have capability to respond humor to statements

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

Interesting but doesn't contain any new approaches or architectures. 
There are already models like GPT3 which has better capabailities
