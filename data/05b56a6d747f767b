EA Seed.

== GOAL

To find graphical glitches in video games with use of AI. 

== DATA

Using various EA games such as battlefield 4 in order to train the AI to see streched pixels. 

== METHODS

Object Classification: Identify that the image contains an object from a class of know objects. 
Object Detection: Identify the approximate location of all the objects in the image.
Semantic Segmentation: Identify the shape of the object in the image by highlighting the individual pixels for each object. 

== RESULTS

The AI became extremly good at spotting things such as :
Placeholder texture
Stretched texture
 Missing texture

== ISSUES

The major issuses in this article were that the thesis done only began exploring this issue. 

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I belive that if this sort of technology would become more effienct that it would allow for game testing to be done a lot quicker and it would allow for a higher quality of game.
