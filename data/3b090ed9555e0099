University of California, Irvine

==== GOAL

What were they trying to do?

==== DATA

Researchers trained the AI with air moisture data over the span of the average weather report using 
data from more than 1,100 fire events in Alaska between 2001 and 2017 from the Alaska Large Fire Database.

==== METHODS

The researchers used satelite data from 2001-2017 of wild fires in Alaska. From this they were able to examine
the topography, vegetation and meteorology. The researchers could train the software to recognise locations that 
were likely to have wildfires.

==== RESULTS

The model is then able to predict approximately 40% of ignitions that lead to large wildfires that account for 75% 
of burned area during that time period.

==== COMMENTS

The news article puts across that this technology will assist in predicting future and ever increasing amount of 
wildfires caused by extreme climate change.
