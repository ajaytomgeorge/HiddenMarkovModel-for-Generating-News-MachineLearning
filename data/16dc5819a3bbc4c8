==== AGENT

Lucas Theis, ML researcher at Twitter.
Zehan Wang, ML Lead at Twitter.

==== GOAL

Theis and wang are trying to use machine learning to automatically crop images uploaded
onto twitter so that the most interesting part of the image is portrayed. This is aimed
to predict what images or posts users want to look at based off preference.

==== DATA

They are getting their data from images uploaded by users day by day. These images can
differ from images of scenery, people and objects.

==== METHODS

They are using a method called cropping using saliency, which mean they are training 
neural networks to identify the most interesting aspect of an image in real-time.

==== RESULTS

The project is currently being introduced in an update for Twitter on the market.
It is too early to determine the success of this new feature as it was only released
last year.

==== COMMENTS

This is certainly a feature that would appeal to a majority of Twitter users who are 
passionate about their posts. It seems like another method to keep users sucked in 
to the application using personal suggestions, which is a tactic many companies are 
currently using.
