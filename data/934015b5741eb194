==== AGENT

Remi.ai is a machine learning AI startup located in Sydney Australia.

==== GOAL

The goal was to use machine learning to help a customer to understand grape health, size and count. The customer
owned a vineyard for the production of wine and the machine learning model was going to help accurately forecast
harvest yields.

==== DATA

The data used was photos of bunches of grapes that were of various ages and also grapes that had certain types
of diseases and damage to them.

==== METHODS

The system was a deep learning algorithm and datasets that was used to automatically monitor the grapes of the
vineyard over the one thousand hectares. The system had the ability to identify the size of the grapes too an
accuracy of 0.3 millimetres and the system was also able to estimate the numbers of grape in each bunch.

==== RESULTS

A pilot of the system was rolled out to the vineyards in the Hunter Valley wine region in New South Wales Australia.


==== COMMENTS

This system is a great example of how AI can be successfully applied to agri foods sector, where monotonous tasks can
be handed over to machines and productivity and wast can be controlled more effectively.
