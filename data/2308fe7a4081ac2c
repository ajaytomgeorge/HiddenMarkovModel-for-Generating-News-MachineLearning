==== AGENT

The project was developed at MIT.

==== GOAL

Their aim was to implement a neural network that will learn and replicate ways to make a pizza through the analysis of photos.

==== DATA

The dataset consisted of 9213 images that show a single pizza, all downloaded from Instagram.
Pictures of 12 pizza toppings such as pepperoni, mushrooms and olives were also included in the dataset.

==== METHODS

They labelled each image in the dataset with descriptions of toppings, excluding the dough, sauce and cheese.
The image then gets fed into the algorithm which identifies the individual toppings, and determines their layers and the order in which they appear.
From there, it generates a step-by-step guide for making the pizza in the given image.

==== RESULTS

The developers tested the tool using pizzas with just two toppings, and found that it could determine the right order 88 percent of the time.
They also acknowledged that the algorithm would likely struggle more with a pizza that has more toppings.

==== COMMENTS

I think that the project itself is interesting and unique.
Although it seems to me that there a lot of ways that it could be expanded.
For one, it could be trained further so that it can identify more things such as shape and size, and provide accurate measurements instead of merely focusing on the toppings.
