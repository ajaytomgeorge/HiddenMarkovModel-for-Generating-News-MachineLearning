== GOAL

Heart Disease Detection using optimised Random Forest Model and Random Search Algorithm.

== DATA

Experiment Data is extracted by database which is available on machine learning UCI repository that is recognised as Cleveland heart failure

== METHODS

Random Search Algorithm-RSA, Random Forest Model-RF, selection algorithms .

== RESULTS

This experiment has solved the problems of overfitting in predicting heart failure and the hybrid model RSA-RF was able to increase performance of Random Forest Model by 3.3%.

== ISSUES

As the training dataset has only 303 instances, there might be possibility of missing few complicated parameters that leads to heart failure.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

Heart failure is one of the identified reason for increasing the death rate especially in aged people and diagnosing it is also a challenging task. With this proposed study, I would recommend to use hybrid algorithm in most popular wearable devices.
