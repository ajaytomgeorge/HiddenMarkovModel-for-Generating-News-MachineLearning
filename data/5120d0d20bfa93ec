Tracking individual turtles in Sri Lanka using machine learning

== DATA

Photos taken by recreational divers

== METHODS

A program called l3s that identifies animals based on their markings

== RESULTS

According to the article they have identified 17 turtles thus far

== ISSUES

Relying on individual divers to submit images may not produce enough data to be significant.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

I think practical citizen science projects like this are really interesting. Tracking animals requires a huge amount of man hours and leveraging passionate amateurs and using their images in a really efficient way using machine learning is an exciting idea. The article itself is a bit content light but did at least provided ample links to more information.
