== GOAL

Identify biases on certain political topics within major news organizations

== DATA

They used 3,078,624 arrticles obtained from 100 media sources, including 83 newspapers

== METHODS

Natural Language Processing was used for this network

== RESULTS

The network was able to classify articles and news agencies on a spectrum of 'left-leaning' to 'right-leaning'
and from 'anti-establishment' to 'pro-establishment'

== ISSUES

It may have been more effective to run two different networks, one for online sources and one for newspapers, 
and identify the biases from each of them.

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

Interesting paper and I believe the article did a good job explaining the system unbiased.
However, it says the network 'could potentially auto-classify the political character of
a publication' - which seems a little orwellian to me.
