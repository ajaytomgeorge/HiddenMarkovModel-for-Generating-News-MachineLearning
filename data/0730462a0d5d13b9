== AGENT 

Platform AI

== GOAL

To finish Beethoven's Tenth Symphony which was left unfinished by him due to health issues. 

== DATA

They use i) Beethoven’s entire body of work, ii)  his creative process and iii) musical sketches of Tenth Symphony Beethoven left behind

== METHODS

Not mentioned.

== RESULTS

They haven't presented the Symphony yet to the public but when they presented it to a group of Beethoven experts, they challenged them to determine where Beethoven’s phrases ended and where the A.I. extrapolation began an they couldn’t, hence we could say it is going in the correct path

== ISSUES

They have to develop a new method, most A.I. available at the time couldn’t continue an uncompleted piece of music beyond a few additional seconds
Although they had 9 Symphonies to learn from, the Tenth Symphony had very few data points
Should AI be trying to replicate the human creative process?

== SCORE 

8. Although I'm not into classical music, Beethoven is considered to be a genius that created very complex musical structures and it is amazing how a machine can replicate his work with such accuracy. I wonder which other genius minds can also be replicated by a machine

== COMMENTS

They missed to include technical information. Nevertheless, I think this use case makes clear how AI will change almost all industries, even those less likely to be disrupted by the technology
