==Goal
Using vocal features to identify early signs of Alzheimer’s disease.

==Data
To develop accurate predictive models, researchers used 1,465 audio data files from 99 healthy individuals 
as well as 151 audio data files recorded from 24 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease

==Methods
Researchers developed machine learning models based on 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR)

==Results
Machine-learning models, results showed that the predictive accuracy was not significantly 
different in diagnostic capability in comparison to other diagnostic tests.

==Issues
Only superficial vocal features were used for analysis, which could lead to a loss of information and misidentification 
if individuals spoke with accents or had unusual pronunciation.

==Comments
It's a new method, but there are few limitations, which can be resolved by further studies
