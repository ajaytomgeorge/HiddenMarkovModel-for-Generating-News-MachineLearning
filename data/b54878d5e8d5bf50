== GOAL
To make it easier to diagnose COVID-19
== DATA
They took chest x-ray images of people with pneumonia, covid and normal
people(as control). 140 people with covid, 140 people with pneumonia and
140 people with no condition. All images were set to 512 x 512 pixels.
== METHODS
The dataset was randomly split into a training set (80%) and a test set
(20%). They used this train-test method to evaluate the supervised learning
algorithm’s performance. The test set is then used to evaluate the trained
model’s performance.
== RESULTS
Their model performed quite well with a sensitivity rate of 100% and a
precision rate of 96%
== ISSUES
Everything looks really good but I’m worried about the fact that they only
used 88 images as a test. I think that’s too small. Another issue with it
is scalability. This technology seems to be very useful but it’s too
expensive in the sense that we wouldn’t be able to test anywhere near as
many people as we test with a standard PCR test daily.
== SCORE
9. Machine learning solution for a real-world problem. Awesome
== COMMENTS
I really liked this project. The only issues I had were pointed out above
but in general it was really cool.
