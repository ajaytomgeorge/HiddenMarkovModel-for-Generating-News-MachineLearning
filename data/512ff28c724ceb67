== GOAL

Predicting student’s native place on real-time using three machine learning methods.

== DATA

Data is collected(331 samples) in the form of Google forms from various students, and personal visits to India.  

== METHODS

Adaptive Moment Estimation, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno

== RESULTS

Three experiments were conducted on the samples to predicts the native of student’s place who’s accuracy levels were more than 90% in all three methods.

== ISSUES

There might be changes of over-fitting of the model as the sample size is very small that makes model  very less effective when it predicts newer datasets.

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

There are multiple parameters to be considered for predicting student’s native place because now a days there are many migrating population.
