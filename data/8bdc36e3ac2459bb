The researchers who worked on this study are Ethan Mark, David Goldsman, Brian Gurbaxani, Pinar Keskinocak 
and Joel Sokol.

==== GOAL

The goal of this study was to use Machine Learning to predict kidney transplant survival using an ensemble 
of methods.

==== DATA

The dataset was provided by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and contains data on recipients who 
underwent kidney transplant surgery from 1987 - 2014 in the US. It contains data on diceased and living recipients.

==== METHODS

A method called Variabled Selection was used, this uses the Breiman-Cutler permutation importance measure to 
rank variables in order of variable importatnce. Harrel's concordance index was used to measure the error rate to 
better increase the overall accuracy of the model.
Recipient's age was ranked the most important varaible by the permutation importance and so on.
A model called Cox Model was also used to select the correct amount of variables to select.
Predictive Models were also used to build a random survival forest and check the performance of the overall model.

==== RESULTS

Many of the models and predictions made were very similar to that recorded in the by the UNOS. Most of 
the results are displayed and explained showing graphs in the article to that would the most appropriate place 
to look for the results as I cannot add graphs to .txt files.

==== COMMENTS

I can see this being used to influence many decisions that could be made for a kidney transplant recipient.
This can help save many lives and prevent many incidents that could have been avoided as well.
