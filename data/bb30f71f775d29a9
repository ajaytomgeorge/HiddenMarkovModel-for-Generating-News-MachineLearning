Pennsylvania State University

== GOAL

Increase soybean and corn yields using Machine Learning to detect weather patterns.

== DATA

Data sets with information on soil type, irrigation, tillage method, seeding rate, row spacing, maturity and weather data.

== METHODS

Simulating growing seasons in random locations. Correlations with weather data. Extreme Gradient Boosting. Baysian optimization. Cross Validation. 

== RESULTS

6% increase in corn crop yield, consistant over 256 background cropping system choices. 14% increase in soybean crop yield, consistant over 128 background cropping system choices.

== ISSUES

The study reports a lack of data, and assumptions that crop management techniques were consistant beweeen different US states.

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

A very useful use of Machine Learning, with oportunities for further research and advancements for agriculture. Would be interesting to see how the ML methods could be adapted for other crops.
