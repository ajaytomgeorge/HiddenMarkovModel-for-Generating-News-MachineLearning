==== AGENT

Google

==== GOAL

Their goal is to use machine learning to manage ad frequency when third-party cookies are unavailable,
this will ultimately improve user privacy, but retain effective advertising for publishers and 
marketers

==== DATA

The data that Google are analysing is essentially all first-party data from users, and also traffic
patterns 

==== METHODS

Using these traffic patterns where third-party cookies are available, and observing them across Google Ad
Manager publishers, Google then create models to predict future traffic patterns when the aforementioned
cookies arenâ€™t present. This makes it possible for Google to estimate how likely it is for users to visit
publishers who are serving the same ads through Google Ad Manager. If there is no third-party cookies present,
Google can then refine the frequency that those ads will be shown to users

==== RESULTS

Google has claimed that by implementing this system, users will have more privacy than before, providing more
privacy than other solutions such as fingerprinting.

==== COMMENTS

This seems like a good solution to repetitive advertisment when users have cookies blocked, blocking cookies
doesnt prevent seeing ads, but does prevent companies from advertising effectivly. By implementing this, there
is no negative affect to the users and yields great benifits for marketers. Users then reap the benifits of
greater privacy.
