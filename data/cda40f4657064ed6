== AGENT

The Hebrew University of Jerusalem

== GOAL

create a Neural Generative Model for Conditional Image Manipulation Based on a Single Image

== DATA

a single image

== METHODS

DeepSIM,Supervised and Unsupervised

== RESULTS

A general purpose approach for training conditional generators, supervised by only a single image-pair.

== ISSUES

One limitation of single-image methods is the requirement for training a separate network for every image.

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

Cool to see what an AI can do with only one image
