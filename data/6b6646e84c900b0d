== AGENT

Researchers at MIT, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and University of California at San Diego.

== GOAL

They want to train robots to manipulate real-world objects and materials that bend and deform without reverting to their original shape.

== DATA

They used a new simulation environment called “PlasticineLab” that, by building knowledge into the simulator, will allow robots to train to manipulate real-world objects and materials that can change shape. 

== METHODS

Reinforcement learning, moving least squares material point method, gradient based methods.

== RESULTS

PlasticineLab was created and, which is a differentiable physics benchmark for soft-body manipulation.

== ISSUES

There were no problems with the work. It is just a simulator of the real world and its materials for the robots to train with using the malleable materials that it finds difficult.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

It is interesting because when robots become more common in everyday life, they will be able to perform tasks using these objects that are hard for the robots to use. It will allow them to do tasks such as cooking and cleaning without difficulty.
