== GOAL

New empirical scoring functions for modern in silico drug discovery

== DATA

four DUD-E datasets www.dockthor.lncc.br
PDBbind v2013 refined set (http://www.pdbbind-cn.org/, version 2013

== METHODS

Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine and random forest algorithms
Optimized MMFF94S force-field terms, solvation and lipophilic interactions terms

== RESULTS

MLR general scoring function trained with the random training set (N = 2073)
exhibited a good performance on tenfold cross-validation experiments (R = 0.548)
and on the curated core set (R = 0.602), and a lower performance on the random test set (R = 0.494)

== ISSUES

PDBbind core set v2013 is an old data set.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

It was an interesting new way of using existing data and methods
