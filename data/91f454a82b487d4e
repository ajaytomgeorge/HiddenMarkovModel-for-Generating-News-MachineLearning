==== AGENT

Tristan Bonds, independent researcher

==== GOAL

To build a machine learning classification model to predict which US counties have the highest incidence of Lyme 
disease; incorporating climate and region data to predict the prevalence of the Black-legged tick, a carrier of 
the bacteria Borrelia burgorferialone which is responsible for the disease.

The main goal for this research was to
- Increase public awareness to prevent people from being infected in the first place
- Provide the Model as a health care resource to increase early diagnosis

Several models were tested in this research; K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression.
Support Vector Machines and Random Forest (SVM)

==== DATA

Data was independently compiled parsing 78,000 csv files and restricting the data set from 2010-2017.
The reasoning behind restricting the data was that there was a spike in the 2009 data that could not be 
accounted for and that recent data is more representative of current trends.

Data Sources Include:
- Centre for Disease Control data
- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration clinic data
- County population estimate data from the Census Bureau

Descriptive features of the data set included 35 columns but deal mainly with;
Temperature, Location, Wind Conditions, Soil Temperature, Geographical Location and Date

60% of data was used for training
20% for validation
20% as test data

==== METHODS

The majority of counties have a low level Lyme disease, which created an imbalance with the classes. To try and
overcome this issue various sampling techniques were employed.

- Random undersampling - Undersample the majority class, in this instance counties with a low level of Lyme disease.
- Random oversampling  - Oversample the minority class, in this instance counties with a high level of Lyme disease.
- SMOTE                - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique; creates randomly generated points for countries 
                         with a low level of Lyme disease.
- ADASYN               - Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach; similar to SMOTE however it creates more synthetic data 
                         for low level samples that are harder to learn and less synthetic data for low level samples
                         that are easier to learn.  

5 different models were employed in this study and compared with each other using 5-fold cross validation was used to 
test how well each model performed;

- K-Nearest Neighbours       - Utilizes the distance between training examples to create classes within the feature
                               space.
- Gaussian Naive Bayes       - Probabilistic classifier that uses Bayes theorem and independence assumptions for 
                               descriptive features.
- Logistic Regression        - Uses regression to separate classes.
- Support Vector Machines    - Attempts to create hyperplane which has the largest distance from the nearest training 
                               data of all classes.
- Random Forest              - Uses random sampling decision trees for regression and classification.

True Positive Rate VS False Positive Rate ROC curve plot was used a measure to show cost versus benefit of the model 
at each threshold.


==== RESULTS

The random forest model was deemed to be the most effective in predicting the likelihood of US counties that would
have a high incidence of Lyme disease.

The results were produced in a confusion matrix reproduced below, which allows us to analyse the performance of
the random forest model;

       predicted
    _______________
   |       |       |
a  |  2742 |  518  |  low
c  |   TN  |   FP  |
t  |_______|_______|
u  |       |       |
a  |   28  |  526  |  high 
l  |   FN  |   TP  |
   |_______|_______|

      low    high

TN = True Negative
TP = True Positive
FN = False Negative
FP = False Negative 

The model had a high recall value of 0.949 for high incidence counties.

Also, for high incidence counties the model correctly predicted 50.3% of counties which had a true positive for 
Lyme disease.

==== COMMENTS

This paper was interesting for the variety of different models used, though more detail could have been given on
their performance. It would also be interesting to see how a Neural Network model and other models would have performed.

Also the focus on data preparation in the first half of the article gave a lot of insight into potential issues
that arise from class imbalance in a training model and useful methods to counteract these issues.
