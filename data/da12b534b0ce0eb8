==== AGENT
A team of scientists at the University of Kentucky
==== GOAL
While the team was able to read the parchment found in a synagogue in En-Gedi Israel with 
‘just’ high-energy x-rays, this time around, due to the manner in which the Pompeii scrolls 
were made and written, they will have to use machine learning to try and solve the mysteries 
hidden in these scrolls.
==== DATA
They will test on two unopened scrolls that belong to the Institut de France in Paris and are part 
of a collection of about 1,800 scrolls that was first discovered in 1752 during excavations of 
Herculaneum
==== METHODS
The team has decided to use both high-energy x-rays and artificial intelligence. The method they are 
using involves photographs of scroll fragments with writing visible to the naked eye. These are then 
fed to “teach machine learning algorithms where ink is expected to be in x-ray scans of the same 
fragments, collected using a number of techniques.”
The team is guided by the concept that “the system will pick out and learn subtle differences between 
inked and blank areas in the x-ray scans, such as differences in the structure of papyrus fibers.” After 
the system is trained on these fragments, the idea is to apply it to the data from the intact scrolls 
and hopefully, that will reveal the text that is contained in the scrolls
==== RESULTS
The team has finished collecting the x-ray data and is now in the process of training the designated 
algorithms, which will then be applied to the scrolls in the coming months.
