== GOAL

Find a new way to quantify the uncertainty in molecular energies predicted by neural networks.

== DATA

They used more than 15,000 examples to train a neural network to predict the potential energy surfaces for these systems. 
With only around 80 percent network-based simulations being successful, they added 5,000 datapoints which saw 92 percent success rate

== METHODS

Synergistic synthesis of first-principles simulation and machine learning that greatly speeds up this process. 
The actual simulations are run only for a small fraction of these molecules, and all those data are fed into a neural network that learns how to predict the same properties for the rest of the molecules. 
Multiple neural networks were used to predict the potential energy surface from the same data.

== RESULTS

They showed how their method can provide significant savings in computational simulations.
Their adversarial approach is used to retrain the neural networks after the standard approach with only 500 data points.
This returned a 97 percent success rate. This is a big win in terms of CPU time from 2000 data points previously and a 92 success rate to this big improvement.

== ISSUES

I had no issues with the news article, it was very informative. My only concern would be the data set they used,
whether it would be applicable to the other molecule substances i.e. was the dataset being trained biased.

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

I thought the study was kind of interesting, it was hard to get into as it was molecular energy predictions.
I think it is great though to see all of the different applications of Machine learning especially to this level of detail.
