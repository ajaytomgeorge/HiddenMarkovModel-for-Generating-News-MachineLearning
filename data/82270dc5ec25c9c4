\
==== AGENT\
Turnitin\
\
==== DATA\
As part of the study, 24 experienced markers used Turnitin\'92s Authorship Investigate tool\
to evaluate 20 student assignments, which included 14 genuine assignments and six that\
were purchased from cheating sites.\
\
==== GOAL\
TurnitIn's goal is to try and improve their system of detecting assingments that have been cheated on using machine\
learning.\
\
==== METHODS\
The AI and ML systems were able to analyse sentence complexity, sentence length, and other stylometrics,\
as well as document information such as date created and last modified and used these information points to train a\
neural network to be able to predict bettwe whether or not a uploaded piece of work was done through cheating or not.\
\
==== RESULTS\
While Turnitin\'92s AI and ML detections weren\'92t perfect (it detected 59% of all cheating cases),\
it\'92s a step in the right direction for more intelligent cheating detections.\
Without AI and ML, markers were only able to detect 48% of cheating instances.\
