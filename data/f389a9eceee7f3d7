== GOAL
Scrutinizing of Fake News using Machine Learning Techniques

== DATA
The dataset are from data-flair. The dataset is framed as 7796*

== METHODS
A computational model is proposed here with a likelihood machine learning technique that detects the fake news. This system combines human factors with a machine learning approach and other decision-making models.

== RESULTS
The project has obtained a higher accuracy of about 93.29% by using dataset for sample from dataflair website.

== ISSUES
The dataset is not real time applicable.

== SCORE
6

== COMMENTS
The proposed model helps to define the correctness of results for achieving a maximum accuracy.
