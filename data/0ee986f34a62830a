== GOAL

Use ML to identify security vulnerabilities and threats in software.

== DATA

Known security threats. Data logs.

== METHODS

Supoervised learning teaching it with known threats so it can make the correct identification.

== RESULTS

Faster identification of potential threats

== ISSUES

Dependent on known vulnerabilities to identify new ones. Any issues in the data could lead to a false sense of security.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

It's a very interesting application of ML and AI. It almost seems like a perfect fit for the technology. Threats and vulnerabilities follow certain patterns. With the increase in ransomeware attacks and data breaches, I hope this can be used to better protect people's data.
