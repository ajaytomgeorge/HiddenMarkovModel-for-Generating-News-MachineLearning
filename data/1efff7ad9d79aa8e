== AGENT

BRAIN Co., Ltd.

== GOAL

Create a machine learning algorithm to distinguish between various pastries at a check-out.

== DATA

Spent many years developing their own data and taking many pictures of various pastries with
many different kinds of cameras with many kinds of differing lighting 

== METHODS

Reinforcement learning

== RESULTS

BakeryScan can now accurately distuingish between a wide array of pastry's and
breads and is utilised in thousands of bakerys around Japan. Their algorithms 
were also used to help develop cancer cell detectors.

== ISSUES

Took many years to develop and is a very impractical and risky investment from
a financial point of view.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

It was really interesting to see the modularity of machine learning algorithms. The fact 
a pastry distinguishing program can help with the development of cancer cell detection programs
is mind boggling.
