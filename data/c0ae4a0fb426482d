== AGENT

Uber

== GOAL

Test self driving vehicles in publci spaces

== DATA

Road network data and instructions for various scenarios hard coded into the machine along with real world data which is taken in real time by the system 
allowing it to learn about it's environment as it evolves.

== METHODS

Unsupervised learning

== RESULTS

A pedestrian was killed

== ISSUES

The system prevented emergency breaking while the vehicle is under computer control if a deceleration of more than 6.5 metres per second per second was 
required.
This was so to minimise the potential for erratic movement of the vehicle, however, it caused the vehicle to not stop upon the late-detection of a pedestrian.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I thought this story was interesting as it highlights the dangers of the use of AI in the real world especially in potentially dangerous aspects of life
such as the driving of a car.
I thought that the reporting of the story was not entirely fair as it states that accident occurred due to the self driving system being "bad" while it is 
clear that the fault which caused the accident is a design flaw in the car itself and not the AI as there is a interface in the centre console, used by the 
driver of the car to monitor diagnostic messages and tag events of interest, which caused the driver to not pay full attention to the road ahead and 
potentially prevent the accident.
A better way of testing the self driving system would be to have two people present - a driver and a person to interact with the computer interface - as is
done by other self-driving companies.
