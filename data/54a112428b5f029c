==== AGENT

The project was developed by the joint team of MIT and UC San Diego.

==== GOAL

Their aim was to use machine learning to be able to identify serial hijackers quickly.
Therefore having a higher chance of preventing their antics.

==== DATA

The dataset that they used consisted of a combination of legitimate autonomous systems and known serial hijackers.

==== METHODS

The group determined the dominant characteristics of a serial hijacker, such as being online less frequently or only while they are skimming data.
They then implemented a machine learning technique called an extremely-randomized trees (extra-trees) classifier, which they trained to identify the aforementioned characteristics.
Therefore when the classifier is provided with an autonomous system, each tree in the classifier decides whether or not it is legitimate by looking at its characteristics.
The majority vote represents the result.

==== RESULTS

The classifier was tested using 19103 autonomous systems, and 934 of these were identified as potential serial hijackers.
However not all of them were identified correctly.
The developer admits that a legitimate autonomous system could sometimes go offline, such as during a blackout.
Typos and misconfigurations could also occur and make a legitimate network look suspicious.
Thus there are still improvements to be made.

==== COMMENTS

I thought that their use of the extra-trees classifier instead of deep learning was interesting, and a good decision. 
I liked how the article used the "telephone game" as an analogy to describe Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), making it easy to understand.
The extra-trees method was also very well explained, again using an analogy of trees in a forest having a "vote of confidence".
