==== AGENT



Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory

==== GOAL

They developed a neural network to make predictions from scientific papers in the 
area of material science.

==== DATA



They used 3.3 million abstracts of scientific papers related to material science, 
thus collecting a vocabulary of ca. 500,000 words.

==== METHODS


They used a Word2vec model on the previously collected data in an unsupervised 
fashion.

==== RESULTS



The article demonstrates the performance of the neural network by giving an example 
of an experiment where old papers (before 2009) were used to predict a new material 
that was indeed discovered in later years (2012).

==== COMMENTS



The article says that this neural network can be trained on and used in any 
discipline and might prove useful for researchers.
