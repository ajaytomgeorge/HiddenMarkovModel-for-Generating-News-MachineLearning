==== AGENT

researchers at the University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa

==== GOAL

To develope a machine learning-based model to estimate people's age by analyzing images of their faces taken in random real-life environments

==== DATA

 large dataset called IMDB-WIKI, which contains over a half-million images of faces taken from IMDB and Wikipedia

==== METHODS
trained the neural network using a dataset of facial images and correponding ages, this was then tuned usig two other databases used to pick up peculiarities and differences.

==== RESULTS
The proposed age classification method is an improvement in accuracy of 8.6 percent (exact) and 3.4 percent (one-off) over the best-reported result on the OUI-Adience dataset

==== COMMENTS

Could be useful for passport control software to confirm DOB of the passport holder. Also in cctv/camera systems to create an age profile of those visiting a certain place/ marketplace to help with marketing purposes atc.
