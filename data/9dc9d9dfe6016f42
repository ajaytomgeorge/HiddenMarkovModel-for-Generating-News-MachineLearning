== AGENT

NYU researchers and collaborators in the U.S and Taiwan did this machine learning
related work.

== GOAL

Their goal was to try and figure out what the best way would be for them to use
the large amount of genomic data available to to predict how organisms react to
changes in nutrition, toxins, and pathogen exposure

== DATA

It was said that focusing on genes whose expression patterns are evolutionary
conserved across species enhance our ability to learn and predict genes for 
groth performance for stable crops and disease outcomes in animals.
What data did they use: what did it look like and how did they get it?

== METHODS

It was said that the researchers demonstrated the genes whose responsivness
to nitrogen are evolutionary conserved between two diverse plant species,
arbidopis and a varietes of corn.

== RESULTS

After the researchers ran experiments they showed that altered gene expression
in Arabidopsis or corn could increase plant growth in solis that have low
nitrogen, which was tested in labs at NYU and in cornfields at the University
of Illinois.

== ISSUES

Some ethical concerns I would have for experimants like this would be 
the saftey of humans and animals consuming these plants and if this 
affects the taste of the food and health of consumers.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

I thought this was a very interesting article as it shows how we can do more
with less, if something like this beomes succesfull this could benefit farmers
all over the world which would bring costs down for a lot of them too.
