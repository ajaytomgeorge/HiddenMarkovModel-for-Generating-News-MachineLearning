== GOAL
Multi-view Learning as a Nonparametric Nonlinear Inter-Battery Factor Analysis

== DATA
Factor analysis aims to determine latent factors, or traits, which summarize a given data set. Inter-battery factor analysis extends this notion to multiple views of the data.
This gives us a flexible formalism for multi-view learning where the latent variables can be used both for exploratory purposes and for learning representations that enable efficient inference for ambiguous estimation tasks. Learning is performed in a Bayesian manner through the formulation of a variational compression scheme which gives a rigorous lower bound on the log likelihood. Our Bayesian framework provides strong regularization during training, allowing the structure of the latent space to be determined efficiently and automatically

== METHODS
Unsupervised

== RESULTS
The model is fully probabilistic, handles a large variety of different data and is capable of modelling very high dimensional observations. We have shown how the model can recover the generating parameters from extremely high dimensional data and how the factorized latent space can be used to model ambiguities in the data. Its power has been demonstrated in challenging cases of representation learning, generation of novel data, discriminative tasks and information transfer between views

== ISSUES
This doesnâ€™t have any issues reported 

== SCORE
6

== COMMENTS
The presented model can be readily used in many interesting application scenarios, especially when data is scarce and comes from several noisy views that individually cannot disambiguate the task.
