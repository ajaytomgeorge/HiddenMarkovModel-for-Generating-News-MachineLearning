== GOAL

To increase crop yield without massive cropland area expansion.

== DATA

Two databases including yield, management, and weather data for maize (n = 17,013) and soybean (n = 24,848), obtained from DAYMET.

== METHODS

Categorical variables were one-hot encoded and then databases were separated in training (80% of database) and testing (20% of database) datasets. For each crop, an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm34 was trained to predict final yield.

== RESULTS

The results suggest that the developed algorithms can accurately estimate maize and soybean yields utilizing database-generated information involving reported environmental, seed genetic, and crop management variables.

== ISSUES

The study was conducted on only maize and soybean crops, some variables weren't accounted for such as pesticides and fertilizers used.

== SCORE

4

== COMMENTS

The article relates the study to climate change however the study only mentions it as a motive and the network doesn't account for it.
