MIT

==== GOAL

To estimate the risk of death from cardiovascular complications.
 
==== DATA

Initially ECG was gathered from survivors of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) by a third party.

==== METHODS

Subsequently, the raw ECG data placed the group of people into two categories of risk based only on the ECG graphs. But MIT decided to take it a step forward and categorised the ECG data into "risky", a dataset where beats of patients who died from cardiovascular failure and "normal" which was a dataset of the beats of those who survived.

==== RESULTS

For new patients, analysts could predict if a sufferer was going to die in a range of 30, 60, 90 or 365 days.

==== COMMENTS

Though a simple concept, the level of accuracy in the final result shows the power of machine learning on a fairly understandable and straightforward task.
