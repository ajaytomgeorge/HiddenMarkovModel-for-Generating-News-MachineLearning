== AGENT

OpenAI

== GOAL

A language model that takes given text and attempts to predict what could come next.

== DATA

What data did they use: what did it look like and how did they get it?

== METHODS

Semi-supervised

== RESULTS

The text generated is much more plausible to a human reader than previous similar attempts.

== ISSUES

One issue could be with copyright and intellectual property. As this technology becomes more effective whether, for example, using a poet's corpus to generate new poetry is a breach of that intellectual property is a question I have, but am unsure about. It feels wrong but I can't give any reasons I can justify.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

Obviously the potential of a technology such as this is extremely exciting. However, GPT-3's is extremely expensive in terms of computing power. If this is the limit of what is accessible to the laymman in 10-20 years as moore's law brings that power to the layman then it would be fairly disappointing.
