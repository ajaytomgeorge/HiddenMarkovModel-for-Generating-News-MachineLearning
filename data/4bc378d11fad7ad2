==== AGENT

Researchers at MIT and the University of California at San Diego (UCSD)
==== GOAL

According to the article, "hijacking IP addresses is an increasingly popular
form of cyber-attack". "Existing efforts to detect IP hijacks tend to look at
specific cases when they’re already in process". The idea behind using machine
learning here is to predict cyber-attacks in advance, "by illuminating some
of the common qualities of cyber-criminals.


==== DATA

Part of the data was taken from the Global Routing Table. The data included "several
years' worth of network operator mailing lists and historical Border Gateway
Protocol data taken every five minutes.

==== METHODS

Using the network operator mailing lists and BGP data, the researchers "observed
particular qualities of malicious actors and then trained a machine-learning model
to automatically identify such behaviors". From this, the training method used was
most likely supervised learning.

==== RESULTS

The overall result is that the system was pretty accurate in identifying malicious
networks. However, "one challenge in developing the system was identifying false
positives". Some network operators employ methods to defend against attacks which
look like IP hijacks. "Because of this issue, the team often had to manually jump in
to identify false positives, which accounted for roughly 20 percent of the cases
identified by their classifier".

==== COMMENTS

Using machine learning in network security is an interesting idea. However, the
article shows there is difficulty in classifying and identifying malicious networks
accurately. "As people increasingly rely on the internet for critical transactions, ..
IP hijacking’s potential for damage" is expected to only get worse.
