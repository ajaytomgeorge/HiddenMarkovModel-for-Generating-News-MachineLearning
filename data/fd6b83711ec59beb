== GOAL

COVID-19 detection in X-ray images using convolutional neural networks

== DATA

A total of 9 Chest X-ray images datasets were used in different stages

== METHODS

Neural Networks

== RESULTS

The approach has a 95.63% accuracy in the test dataset for a threshold of 0.5. Changing the threshold shows an increase in the accuracy of models up to 98%.

== ISSUES

None 

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

The method is not new but love the way they have applied it
