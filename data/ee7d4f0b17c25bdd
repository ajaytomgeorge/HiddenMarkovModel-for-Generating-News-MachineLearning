GOAL:
		 using the Titanic passenger data set and build a model for predicting the survival of a given passenger using Azure ML.

DATA:
		This version of the Titanic dataset can be retrieved from the Kaggle website, specifically their “train” data (59.76 kb). 
		The dataset also has 12 columns that each record an attribute about each occupant’s circumstances and demographic. 

METHODS:
		preprocess the dateset:
			Drop the columns that do not add immediate value for data mining or hold too many missing categorical values to be a reliable predictor attribute
			Identify categorical attributes and cast them into categorical features using the metadata editor module.
			Scrub the missing values from the following columns using the missing scrubber module:
			Embarked: dropped 2 rows that contained missing values of embarked.
			Tell Azure ML what it is trying to predict by casting the response class into a label using the metadata editor module.
			Randomly split and partition the data into 70% training and 30% scoring using the split module.

		Chose to go with a two-class boosted decision tree and a two-class decision forest
		 they used separate train model modules and score model modules for both algorithms to train separately on the same dataset.
		 the algorithms were trained with their default settings. 
		 Both model's performance were evaluated and compared together using a single evaluate model module.
RESULTS:
		Both models performed rather fairly (~0.81 RoC AuC each). The boosted decision tree got an overall slightly higher RoC AuC, however it was lower in accuracy,
		both models as they stand are perfectly fine for deployment,
COMMENTS:
		Machine learning can be used in so many area, but this one is useless.
