==== GOAL
Currently, analyzing heart function on cardiac MRI scans takes approximately 13 minutes for humans. 
Utilizing artificial intelligence in the form of machine learning, a scan can be analyzed with 
comparable precision in approximately four seconds.
==== DATA
Researchers trained a neural network to read the cardiac MRI scans and the results of almost 600 
patients. When the AI was tested for precision compared to an expert and trainee on 110 separate 
patients from multiple centers, researchers found that there was no significant difference in accuracy.
==== METHODS
Cardiovascular MRI offers unparalleled image quality for assessing heart structure and function; however, 
current manual analysis remains basic and outdated. Automated machine learning techniques offer the 
potential to change this and radically improve efficiency, and we look forward to further research that 
could validate its superiority to human analysis
==== RESULTS
Although the study did not demonstrate superiority of AI over human experts and was not used 
prospectively for clinical assessment of patient outcomes, this study highlights the potential 
that such techniques could have in the future to improve analysis and influence clinical decision 
making for patients with heart disease.
