== AGENT
Researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.
== GOAL
To create an algorithm to speed up machine learning using Approximate Matrix Multiplication (AMM). They called this algorithm MADDNESS.
== DATA
UCR Time Series Archive datasets for comparison with MADDNESS.
== METHODS
Regression Learning (Binary Regression).
== RESULTS
The MADDNESS algorithm runs 10 times faster than other approximation algorithms (such as Bolt, etc) and 100 times faster than accurate matrix 
multiplication.
== ISSUES
This algorithm is quite new (introduced earlier this year), and AMM methods can produce some output error.
== SCORE
8
== COMMENTS
This article is very interesting as it shows that by using AMM methods rather than accurate matrix multiplication, machine learning speeds can 
be greatly increased.
