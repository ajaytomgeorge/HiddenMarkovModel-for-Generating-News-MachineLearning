== AGENT
ScaleOut Software

== GOAL
Integration of machine learning with real-time digital for real-time monitoring across a wide variety of applications.

== DATA
Data collected from a vast variet of applications such as cloud-based real time system that can track a fleet of trucks to identify subtle changes in ke engine paremeteres to avoid costly failures.


== METHODS
Implementing host machine learning and statystical analysis algorithms


== RESULTS
A tool that provides three configuration options for analyzing numeric parameters contained within incoming messages to spot issues as they are:

    Spike Detection: Tracks a single parameter from a data source to identify a spike in its values over time using an adaptive kernel density estimation algorithm implemented by ML.NET.

    Trend Detection: Also tracks a single parameter to identify a trend change, such as an unexpected increase over time for a parameter that is normally stable, using a linear regression algorithm that detects inflection points.

    Multi-Variable Anomaly Detection: Tracks a set of related parameters in aggregate to identify anomalies using a user-selected machine-learning algorithm implemented by ML.NET that performs binary classification with supervised learning.


== ISSUES
Using Microsoft's ML.NET machine learning library means that ScaleOut Software relyies on them for their project.


== SCORE
5

== COMMENTS
Overall the article was not bad but it did not interest me personally. I am not a fan of relying on other libraries for a project of that scale.
