==== AGENT

The project is a collaboration between the University of Technology Sydney and The Ripper Group.

==== GOAL

Their aim was to use real-time aerial imagery and apply machine learning techniques to it to detect sharks and other potential threats.

==== DATA

The datasets used were videos taken by a drone flying above different Australian beaches.
These videos were collected by The Ripper Group.
Each video was also manually annotated to specify the location of sharks and other objects.

==== METHODS

A deep learning algorithm was implemented.
It was trained using the videos and annotations to locate and classify objects.
When it receives streaming imagery from the drone camera, it attempts to identify all objects in the scene.
When valid objects are detected, they are sorted into one of the 16 categories including shark, whale, dolphin, rays, different types of boats, surfers, and swimmers.

==== RESULTS

The algorithm has been proven to have more than 90 percent accuracy, significantly improving aerial detection.
It has already been used across a dozen popular beaches in New South Wales and Queensland, and has been received positively by end-users and communities alike.
In January 2018, it was used to rescue two young swimmers caught in a rip.

==== COMMENTS

In my opinion, the way that machine learning was implemented in this project was effective, in particular the use of deep learning.
However I believe that the training dataset could have been expanded, because currently it is limited to Australian beaches.
Hence there could be threats in other beaches that do not appear in the Australian dataset.
I also appreciate how the article followed up on the success of the project by providing examples of instances when it was used.
