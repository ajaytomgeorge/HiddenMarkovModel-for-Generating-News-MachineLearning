==== AGENT

A group of MIT engineers

==== GOAL

Through machine learning, enable a robot to successfully play Jenga, which
would show that a "machine learning approach could help robots assemble
cellphones and other small parts in a manufacturing line.

==== DATA

The data was obtained from the components of the robot - a force-sensing
wrist cuff and an external camera.

==== METHODS

To begin with, the training method used was the following: "the robot first
chose a random block and a location on the block against which to push.
It then exerted a small amount of force in an attempt to push the block out
of the tower. For each block attempt, a computer recorded the associated visual
and force measurements and labeled whether each attempt was a success.
Rather than carry out tens of thousands of such attempts, the robot trained
on just about 300, with attempts of similar measurements and outcomes grouped
in clusters representing certain block behaviors".

==== RESULTS

The machine learning model enabled the robot to play Jenga successfully. Interestingly,
the "clustering technique dramatically increases the efficiency with which the robot
can learn to play the game.


==== COMMENTS

The clustering technique used in order to significantly cut down the time needed to
train the model was impressive. "The researchers tested their approach against other
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. '“Compared with our approach, these algorithms
need to explore orders of magnitude more towers to learn the game'”.
