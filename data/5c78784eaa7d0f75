==== AGENT
Microsoft

==== GOAL
To read news articles online, and compose & post comments about the article. 

==== DATA
The model was trained on collection of news articles and the corresponding comments. 

==== METHODS
The system is comprised of 2 Neural Network, one reads the news article to identify the key points, and the other
generates the comments based on the outputs of the first article.

==== RESULTS
The model emulates comments quite well, when given a news article about Fifa rankings, it produced the following
comments: "If itï¿½s heavily based on the 2018 WC, hence England leaping up the rankings, how are Brazil at 3?",
"England above Spain, Portugal and Germany. Interesting."

==== COMMENTS
This is the first article I've seen mention a neural network being used as an input for a second neural net.
