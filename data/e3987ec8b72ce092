==== GOAL

To predict wind turbine generation ahead of time, allowing for scheduling of sale of electricity to the grid.
By scheduling this delivery, a higher price per megawatt-hour could be obtained

==== DATA

Data was obtained both from widely available weather forcasts - which use met masts to gather data - and historical wind turbine data.
The turbine data was obtained though numerous sensors that continously measure different variables eg. rotor speed, generator temperature, ambient temperature etc.
While not specified, this data would be of high granularity eg. 10-minute data spanning at least 1 year of operation.

==== METHODS

They trained a neural network on the data to configure a system that would predict wind power output 36 hours ahead of time.
While not mentioned, this was likely done using supervised learning as power output is measured by the turbine.

==== RESULTS

They claim it has boosted the value of their produced wind energy by 20%.

==== COMMENTS

Wind energy is now being traded in a day-ahead market, so accuracy in the prediction of energy output is becoming a key element in the sale of wind energy.
This is a perfect use case for ML.
