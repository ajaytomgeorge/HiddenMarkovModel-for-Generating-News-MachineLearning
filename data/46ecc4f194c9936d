==== AGENT

Nate Silver, columnist with the New York Times.

==== GOAL

To use polling data to predict state winners in the 2012 US Presidential Election. Also to predict which candidate would win
the vote in each state.

==== DATA

The data used was polling data which was collected in the months leading up to the 2012 Presidential Election. The data included state, year, Boolean variable for Republican or Democrat.

==== METHODS

A mathematical model of how people would vote on a particular day was constructed, this was called the
nowcast, ie how people would vote if they had to today. There were numerous variables that would affect
How a person would vote, so these vote were taken into account in the model, such as what area a person
came from, also what race a person is.
This model is used as a baseline of voting from that point in time. The model takes into account changes
that happen, both regional and state wise, and these are fed into the model. For example if unemployment
in an area went down the incumbent party will gain popularity in that area. All of these variable were then
used with a logistic regression model and this is what was used to make the prediction for the Presidential
Election.


==== RESULTS

Nate Silver was one of the few main stream commentators who successfully predicted the outcome of the 2012
Presidential Election.

==== COMMENTS

Again a pretty standard regression model can be used with great affect to make predictions that no one else
can see.
