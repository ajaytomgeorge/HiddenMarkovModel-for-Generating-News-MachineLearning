The people who worked on this research are Xingyun Liu, Bingli Sun, Zhan Zhang, Yameng Wang, Haina Tang 
and Tingshao Zhu. 

==== GOAL

Research was done to reveal sleep quality using machine learning models. Without the need for questionnaires, 
surveys, emails, etc.

==== DATA

Data was collected from 59 sleeping patients with no disabilities using the Pitsburgh Sleep Quality Index and gait data 
to see how well people have slept, have they moved around too much, etc.
Some data that was collected was a mean score of the Pistburgh Sleep Quality Index was 7.32 with a standard deiviation of 
3.77. Collecting 3600 frames of gait data which lasted 2 mins for every participant.
The scale for this is between 0 - 21 and the lower the number the higher the quality sleep. So on average everyone got a good 
quality sleep.

==== METHODS
59 students without disablilites were picked to sleep and using a kinect and Pitsburgh Sleep Quality Index along with 
gait data was stored. Many joints of the person were recorded, such as Head, Wrists, Thumbs, etc. Then this data would be sent 
to a machine learning model to calculate the quality of sleep that person got by means of linear regression since there are 
only two states, good sleep and bad sleep quality.
So with the 59 students they took a Pitsburgh Sleep Quality Index test and then went to sleep while two kinects sensors 
then captured gait data and their movements by checking the joints movements in the persons body. Then this data was and then 
the result was calculated. Then the data calculated was compared to the Pitsburgh Sleep Quality Index test and then the model would 
learn from this. Eventually the Pistburgh Sleep Quality Index test would no longer be needed as the model would eventually learn enough 
for it to be accurate enough. There is also feature selection and feature extraction involved too, but that would be too much to mention here.

==== RESULTS

The results can be seen in the DATA section also. The data was fairly accurate and can be used as a replacement to 
intrusive questionnaires, etc.

==== COMMENTS

I think this is a very interesting field of research as I believe it can help many people.
I myself have been diagnosed with insomnia and I can see how this would benefit me, since it can help me learn what 
would be the best actions to help me get better sleep. If I see my score got lower then I know what I'm doing is helpful, it can 
also be used to see what bad things could affect my sleep as well.
One issue I can with this is that in the article it says this is less intrusive than questionnaires, but I believe it 
to be more intrusive as you have to sleep with some cameras recording your movements.
