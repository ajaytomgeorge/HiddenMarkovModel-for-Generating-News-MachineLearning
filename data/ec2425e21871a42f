== AGENT

SEOUK JUN KIM

== GOAL

Develop a prediction model for professional league of legends games

== DATA

Used the RiotAPI  to collect 1045 matches with 80 percent as training set, 10 percent as dev set, 10 percent test set

== METHODS

Vanilla deep neural  with four hidden layers along with batch training

== RESULTS

Training accuracy: 0.7255
Validation accuracy: 0.6905
Test accuracy: 0.7033
with performance of the neural network depending on the parameters/hyper-parameters

== ISSUES

Collection of data is difficult with rate limits on the RiotAPI, information may also be inaccurate if players ingame choose to swap positions etc.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

It definitely has potential to be expanded upon in a multitude of ways. It is also interesting to think about the implications for game balance or professional metas based off of ML analysis
