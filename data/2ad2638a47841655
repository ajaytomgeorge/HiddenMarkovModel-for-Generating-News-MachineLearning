==== GOAL

Develop a machine learning algorithm to distinguish between clinically relevant molecular subtypes 
of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from radiomic features.

==== DATA

They got their data from patients who were suffering from PDAC and used that to train and test
the machine.

==== METHODS

They trained the AI using supervised methods with data from patients(70%) and then tested the findings 
against the remaining set of patients(30%)

==== RESULTS

They found that entropy was the most important radiomic feature evaluated.

==== COMMENTS

This article covers the research produced well, with a clear breakdown that makes a non-expert able to 
follow along.
