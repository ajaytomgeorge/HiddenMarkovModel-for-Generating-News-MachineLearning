==== GOAL

Determine how much methane is emitted from the ocean into the atmosphere each year

==== DATA

They used all availbale methane data from the ocean. Thhrough research I discovered it would be in the form of CSV 
files.

==== METHODS

The model was trained on the data set mentioned above. There was substantial data available.

==== RESULTS

The models were able to recognize systematic patterns in the methane data, allowing the researchers to predict what the 
emissions are likely to be, even in regions where no direct observations have been made.

==== COMMENTS

It was a well written article. I would have preferred if they gave more detail on the thechniques that they used.
