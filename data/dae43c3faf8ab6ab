== AGENT

DeepMind, the University of Exeter in England and the Met Office

== GOAL

To build an AI model capable of predicting whether it will rain in the near future

== DATA

A sequence of map examples, each one capturing weather data over five minute intervals during the training stage.
Data was provided by the Met Office.

== METHODS

Used a generative adversarial network to produce a sequence of maps indicating where it's going to rain.
Method was unsupervised.

== RESULTS

Could generate the next series of maps to predict rainfall in five minute intervals up to 90 minutes given four previous examples.

== ISSUES

It's performance was judged by 50 expert meteorologists to rank the predictive maps compared to maps produced by traditional methods.
This could introduce confirmation bias on judging the quality of the results if the meteorologists believed the system could be better than
traditional methods.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

I thought it was interesting because it took a complicated sounding issue and gave it a simple solution by using Machine Learning to avoid
having to do complicated calculations using thermodynamics, and therefore using less computational power achieve the same result.
It was an interesting new method of predicting the weather.
