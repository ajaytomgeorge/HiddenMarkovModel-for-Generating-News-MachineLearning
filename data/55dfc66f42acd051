== AGENT

Greek border control

== GOAL

Use ML to identify the people most likely to test positive for COVID-19.

== DATA

The persons nationality, age, gender.

== METHODS

Reinforcement Learning using large batches of global covid data

== RESULTS

Doubled the accuracy of border covid tests by targetting people more likely to test positive.

== ISSUES

Any time nationality is used in an algorithm it can result in unintentional discrimination. Algorithm is not 100% accurate. Global covid data can be skewed by dishonest governments.

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

The article raises many of the issues with this sort of ML. COVID data is dependent on the frequency and quality of a country's covid tests. It's good to see that the algorithm is trying to operate within GDPR even at the cost of accuracy. I think it would be interesting to see it's accuracy with the data it currently cannot use. Will definitely help control covid and reduce the risks of travel.
