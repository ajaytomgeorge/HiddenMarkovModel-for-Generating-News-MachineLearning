==== AGENT

YouTube

==== GOAL

Recommend Videos

==== DATA

Data was acquired from YouTube

==== METHODS

They used various Deep Learning Neural Network approaches to create a Recommender System for YouTube. It was done using Tensorflow. One network took in user activity history as well as IDs of videos being watched, search history, and user-level demographics) and outputs a few hundred videos that might broadly be applicable to the user. So as to creat precise recommendations for the user. While thje other neural network takes a richer set of features for each video, and scoring each item from the candidate generation network.So it essentially ranks the recommendations generated by the first network.

==== RESULTS

They were able too effectively
assimilate many signals and model their interaction with layers of depth, outperforming previous matrix factorization
approaches used at YouTube.

==== COMMENTS

I think that these systems are getting more popular as people are spending more time and money online and online services. So there is a push to be able to generate recommendations so as to keep people on certain services.
