== GOAL

Use ML to identify cancer cells on the basis of pH, for surgical applications.

== DATA

Datasheets containing the single-cell colorimetric features. Color images are acquired using an optical microscope equipped with a color digital camera.

== METHODS

t-sne used to 2-d project plot of breast cell lines for classification. 10-fold cross-validation. Logistic regression was best for classification.

== RESULTS

Model can provide answers in about half an hour with 95% accuracy.

== ISSUES

This seems to be very well thought through, perhaps more data is needed to increase accuracy.
== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Your comments on this: did you think it was interesting and why, would
you have done it differently, was the reporting in the Press
reasonable or did they get lots of stuff wrong, etc. Was the method new,
or was it interesting new data, or an interesting new way of using existing
data and methods?

The methodology was quite novel, using computer vision techniques to identify cancer cells using a pH sensitive dye. Extremely useful application.
