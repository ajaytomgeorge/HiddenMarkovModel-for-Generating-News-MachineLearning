== GOAL

To reduce false positives and improve fraud detection

== DATA

GBG's Digital Risk Management and Intelligence platform passes data from origination and transactions directly into the machine learning models,
which bypasses the need for data extraction

== METHODS

Utilises both supervised and unsupervised algorithms. 
These algorithms are built into their core financial crime platform.
These can be easily and quickly configured, trained and deployed via a low code/no code user interface. 

== RESULTS

Increase in Fraud detection of up to 30% for credit card applications. 
Another Tier 1 global bank has also tested its machine learning technology to see a 22% reduction in false positives for credit card applications.

== ISSUES

I dont see many issues with this other than it will be hard to keep up with new and innovative fraud attacks as they will constantly evolve. 

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I thought this was quite interesting and cool that people are trying to tackle the innovativeness and complexity in which fraud attacks are 
being executed these days. I thought the article showed the main parts of the project but I would have liked a link to a paper or something so I
could have read more about it.
