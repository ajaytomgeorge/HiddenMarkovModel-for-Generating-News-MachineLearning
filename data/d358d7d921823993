==== METHODS

Various different open source libraries and algorithms, as well as TensorFlow is used to acheieve a Speech-to-text machine. According to their github, they base their technique on Baidu's research paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567), which is itself a 'well-optimized RNN training system'. http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/speech/publi/2010/mikolov_interspeech2010_IS100722.pdf

==== RESULTS

There is a github project available for the public to use. The project is currently in alpha stage. It's hard to say how well it's currently going.

==== COMMENTS

Mozilla claims that using machine learning for speech recognition provides more accuracy, and is a simpler process than engineering a typical speech recognition system.
