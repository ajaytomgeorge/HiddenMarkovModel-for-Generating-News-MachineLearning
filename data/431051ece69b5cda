==== AGENT

Google

==== GOAL

Increase the resolution of low-quality images.

==== DATA

Dataset is formed of pairs of images, one high resolution, one low resolution.

==== METHODS

GANs comprised of two networks, pitting one against the other. By using GANs to find maps that are applied to each pixel on the low-resolution image. The result is a smaller file but one of commensurate quality to the high-resolution image.

==== RESULTS

RAISR produces results that are comparable to or better than other super-resolution methods, and 10 to 100 times faster, it can be run on mobile device.

==== COMMENTS

It cannot recover images with many details.
