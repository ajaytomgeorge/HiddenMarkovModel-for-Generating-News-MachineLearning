==== AGENT

AXA Research and Developement team in Japan.

==== GOAL

The goal was to use machine learning in a POC to optimize pricing to predict the insurance 
claims known as a large-loss, where the company would lose over 10,000 from a trffic 
accident.

==== DATA

AXA takes in details such as the age, region and premium amount of a driver and age of the 
vehicle. AXA also used data in Google Compute Engine to train the model.

==== METHODS

They used a model called the tensor flow to enter the data into a signle vector with 70 dimensions
and put this into a deep learning model. The hyperparameters are tuned so that the end result has 
an accuracy rate of 78%.

==== RESULTS

This feature was a success and is currently in use by AXA Insurance worldwide. This feature allows AXA 
adjusters to know which clients are at most risk of Large-Loss.

==== COMMENTS

This is a great feature that almost eliminates the problem of large-loss and other insurance companies 
should implement neural networks for this feature.
