Wang, Yilun, and Michal Kosinski. “Deep Neural Networks Are More Accurate than Humans at Detecting Sexual Orientation from Facial Images.” OSF, 23 Oct. 2018. Web.n

==== AGENT

Researchers at Stanford University

==== GOAL

to test whether a deep neural network can be trained to discern individuals' sexual orientations from their photographs

==== DATA

32,326 facial images from an internet dating website, the authors selected photographs of nearly 8000 men and nearly 7000 women

==== METHODS

Facial features were extracted from the images using a widely employed DNN, called VGG-Face and data points on the face of hetero and gay subjects were averaged and compared in order to correctly predict the sexual orientation of the person in a picture.

==== RESULTS

Results proved that the algorithim could successfully predict the sexual orientation and proved to be more accurate than a human at predicting sexual orientations 

==== COMMENTS

the comparison of a trained algorithim and an untrained human eye, therefore its really not a fair contest between the two.
