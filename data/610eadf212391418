== GOAL
understand how the new output will affect the overall end-to-end performance of the autonomous vehicle system.

== DATA
The framework starts with labeling or detecting crash and other accident scenarios and then transferring those scenarios into new training sets


== METHODS
Analyyzing crash and other accident scenarios and training the framework using machine learning to assess how it will affect the overall end-to-end performance of the autonomouse vehicle system.

== RESULTS
Successful reduction of complexities and enabling ML developers to focus on validating models.

== ISSUES
Changing the data may set Machine learningengineers back and could disrupt the experiment.


== SCORE
8

== COMMENTS
Machine learning and vehicles alwaus interested me and this article was very insightful.
