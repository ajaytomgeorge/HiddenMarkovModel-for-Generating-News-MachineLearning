== AGENT

Allen Institute for Cell Science.

== GOAL

Help visualize changes in the spatial organization of cells as they move from
one state to another.

== DATA

Images the Institute carried.

== METHODS

Deep Learning 

== RESULTS

"Shockingly Impressive"

== ISSUES

The sample set the algorithm is learning from is very small. Despite what the
researchers say a large sample set is always good to have.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

Not a field I would follow personally but its a good example of a computer
being able to understand something based on visual data that a human wouldn't at first glance.
