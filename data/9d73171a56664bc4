== GOAL

Machine to target COVID testing of travellers

== DATA

Passengers that show outcomes from tests for SARS-CoV-2 and ones that don't show the outcomes

== METHODS

Algorithm draws on the reinforcement-learning stategies that lead to 
advances in online commerce and marketing

== RESULTS

This doubled the efficiency in testing, the number of cases detected per test 
and allowed the border agents to test and quarantine the right people

== ISSUES

The accuracy of the system was reduced beacuse the authors of the 
system had to limit the data available to the algorithm

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

This system seems very useful in saving time and funds to for testing passengers, 
it seems better as the agents don't have to pick the passengers, which may have caused problems.
The article portrayed the info in good manner and kept me as the reader interested.
It also expains issues that the creators of the algorithm had to go through with in terms of the
data that they could share with the system and why the chose to approach the task with the method 
they did although I feel there could have been more on the chosen method.
