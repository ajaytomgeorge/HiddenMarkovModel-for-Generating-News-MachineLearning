Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

==Goal
Accelerating the protein engineering process.

==Data
Combining all the proteins in the database with the specific evolutionary history of the target protein to 
improve the prediction efficiency.

==Methods
Predective Model, Supervised Learning

==Results
ECNet was used to engineer TEM-1 β-lactamase -; an enzyme that confers resistance to β-lactam antibiotics 
and identify variants that had improved fitness

==Score
9

==Comments
It's interesting new data, but further study is still left to improve and train the model.
