== AGENT
Uber.
== GOAL
To improve anomaly detection in Uber's Machine Learning models.
== DATA
The data Uber used to detect anomalies previously had been collected throughout the years. However, due to the unpredictability of the 
Covid-19 pandemic, all this data was rendered obsolete for now. So to counter this, Uber decided to use recency bias in it's Machine Learning 
models. This basically meant that the effect of the pandemic on Uber's data was not considered as an anomaly.
== METHODS
The machine learning methods were not stated in the article, however I did some research and found that unsupervised learning is typically used 
for anomaly detection.
== RESULTS
The result of adjusting the dataset based off more recent data meant that Uber's anomaly detection machine learning model became more 
accurate and consistent with what would be considered an anomaly during a global pandemic.
== ISSUES
I don't see any issues with what is discussed in the article.
== SCORE
7
== COMMENTS
I found this article interesting as it displays a big company like Uber making adjustments to the data being fed into their Machine Learning 
models in order to adapt to the ever-changing and unpredictable pandemic situation. I think incorporating recency bias into their dataset was 
a smart way to avoid inconsistent anomalies being thrown up, as the recent data was the new reality, not an anomaly. The Machine Learning 
methods were not mentioned in this article.
