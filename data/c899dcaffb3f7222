==== AGENT

This research was worked on by Mark V. Albert, Konrad Kording, Megan Herrmann and Arun Jayaraman.

==== GOAL

The goal of this research was to prevent falls in elderly people as it's a very common source of injury, distress 
and mortality events. The purpose of the research was to find and demonstrate the best techniques to reliably 
detect falls and to also automatically classify each type of fall, with the end goal of decreasing these falling 
scenarios.

==== DATA

15 Subjects were asked to simulate 4 different types of falls: Left and Right Lateral, Forward trips and Backward slips
while wearing mobile phones with built-in accelerometers.
9 of the subjects also carried the phones for 10 days to also help with the simulation and learning to collect more data.
Many different activities were done during the testing to also better classify different falls and to check for and remove any false positives.

==== METHODS

Most of the methods are explained above in the DATA section. In the accelerometers and phones, there was a recorded value 
for the x, y and z-axis which helped determine lateral movement along with forward and backwards movement. The z-axis along with 
the speed of the subject would be recorded and with this calculations could be made taking into account the subjects 
y-axis to check if they fell and then the direction they went in using the x and z-axis. This would allow for the classification of 
the type of fall occured.
This data was then recorded and used to find better ways to prevent falls and how to recover from falls if an elderly 
person was to fall.
To properly detect falls, they also recorded daily activities and checked for any false positives to better teach the 
learning model.

==== RESULTS

The learning model managed to classify real falls from just daily activities with an accuracy of 98% for the pooled subjects, 
but dropped by 1% down to 97% accurate when used subject-wide crossvalidation was used which is very impressive. 
With their study they estimate that in a an average week there would be 2-3 non-falls that would be misclassified and recorded.
There are also some graphs and visual data shown in the article showing these numbers as well.

==== COMMENTS

I think this is a very interesting field of research. But I fail to understand how this would help people recover from 
a fall. I can see how it may help prevent a fall, but the application seems to only detect trips in the forward direction. 
Many people can trip in any direction, or slip forward or laterally. Not just backwards.
I can see people tripping sideways and it being classified as a lateral fall instead of a lateral trip.
I can see it being useful as a sort of emergency tool though, maybe used by elderly people when they trip and fall it could 
notify any local emergency services of their location and issue along with sending the type of fall so emergency services 
know what kind of emergency it is.
So overall I think this is definitely something that could benefit many people and could be used to teach people 
of the most common ways people fall. But there are also some shortcomings with its classification and usefulness right now.
