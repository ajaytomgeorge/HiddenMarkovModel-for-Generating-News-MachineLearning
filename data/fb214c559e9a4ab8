\
==== AGENT\
Stanford university graduates\
\
==== DATA\
histology images were fed into a machine learning algorithm, along with pathologist-determined diagnoses,\
training it to distinguish lung cancer from normal tissue, and two different types of lung cancer from each other.\
Then he fed in survival data for those slides, letting the system learn how that information correlated with the images.\
Finally, he added in new slides that the model hadn\'92t seen before, and asked the all-important longevity question.\
\
==== GOAL\
Provide more accurate predictions into the treatment of cancer.\
\
==== METHODS\
The machine learning entity would be fed with images and then learn to output information in relation to the image.\
The machine would output data concering the diagnosis, the prognosis, tumor evolution and best drug treatments\
\
==== RESULTS\
The implementation was a success as prior to using ML in the treatment of cancer all cancer patients would be lumped\
together and treated the same way regardless of the finer details of their cancer.\
The computer learned to predict the presence of six forms mutations from the pathology slides\
with accuracy ranging from 73 to 86 percent.\
