== AGENT

Leading a group of scientists at the creative A.I. start-up Playform AI and musicians and historians.

== GOAL

To use Artificial Intelligence to complete Beethoven’s Unfinished Tenth Symphony.

== DATA

The team had to go through Beethoven’s sketches and process his entire body of work. 

== METHODS

Supervised

== RESULTS

They were able to compose the 10th symphony of Beethoven which sounded similar to his previous works. It shows how artificial intelligence can be used to compose music. 

== ISSUES

No issues. Seems like a good effort.


== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

It was interesting to know how they used his previous symphonies as a template and attempted to put together the puzzle of where each fragment of sketches would go. AI also had to figure out how to orchestrate the composition which involved assigning different instruments for different phrases. In this way, AI can be used by artists to express themselves in unique ways.
