University of California, Irvine

==== GOAL

Creating a model, based around a machine learning algorithm, that could predict the final size of a wildfire and thus estimate its lifespan.

==== DATA

Alaska was used as a study area due to its recent plague of forest fires.
Climate data, atmospheric conditions, and vegetation at the starting point of the fire are loaded into the model.

==== METHODS

A decision tree algorithm is the core of the model that learns with each new data point, allowing it to quickly figure out identifiers for large fires.
The model can also consider multiple fires running simultaneously.

==== RESULTS

The method used by the model can also be used by humans, and has been, however the machine learning system is much more efficient and quick, therefore can be considered a success. 

==== COMMENTS

This same model can also be applied to social media posts interestingly enough, since spread and lifespan apply to both.
