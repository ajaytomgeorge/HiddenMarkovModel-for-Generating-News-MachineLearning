==== AGENT

Washington State University

==== GOAL

The researchers wanted to way to identify previously unrecognized antibiotic-resistance genes in bacteria.

==== DATA

The data was a mix of text and CSV

==== METHODS

They created ML models and also used game theory techniques in conjuction to help achieve less errors in their model.

==== RESULTS

By employing machine learning and game theory, the researchers were able to determine with 93 to 99 percent accuracy 
the presence of antibiotic-resistant genes in three different types of bacteria.

==== COMMENTS

The article was very limited in their discussion of what they actually did to accomplish their goal.
