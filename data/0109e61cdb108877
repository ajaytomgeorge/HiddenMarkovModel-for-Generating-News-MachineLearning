==== AGENT

Anthony Levandowski at Uber 

==== GOAL

Perform an unlicensed experimental test of self-driving vehicles 

==== DATA

The data read in this experiment was real-time data from cameras and sensors analysing the cars surroundings. 

==== METHODS

After the data was ran through algorithms the AI car would then receive its output signals to then preform the appropriate actions. 
These results may include answers to questions like, what colour the light was, if there where pedestrians, how far away the car was in front etc.
The algorithms used in the test was gathered from years of testing through a company that was bought by Uber called OTTO. An autonomous truck driving company
that was run by Anthony Levandowski. After Uber bought OTTO Anthony became a leading member of the self-driving team at Uber.
Anthony then worked with the team at Uber to develop personal self-driving cars until they felt it was ready for a real-world test. 

==== RESULTS

The self-driving car failed to recognise six traffic lights resulting in the car running a red light.

==== COMMENTS

autonomous driving is definitely on its way to the streets but as clearly demonstrated by this experiment if not quite there yet.
Machine learning has come a long way to allow a car to perform the way it did in the test only misreading six traffic lights, but that’s not to a standard that can be excepted due to what could have happened. 
Such as if there would have been a pedestrian crossing at this time they could have been hurt or even fatally injured.
