== GOAL

Reconstruct paintings that were destroyed during a fire in WW2

== DATA

The artists surviving paintings, black and white photos of the painints, research from scholars.

== METHODS

A ML algorithm was trained on 91,749 pieces of art. Then the algorithm was trained on Klimt's work. It seems to be some form of regression ML. 

== RESULTS

The lost paintings were restored digitally, though it's not known if the reconstructions are correct.

== ISSUES

Perhaps this analyitical reconstruction of lost art could allow someone to make very authentic counterfeits of lost paintings.  

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

It's always tragic when art is lost. I think the technology could be expanded to do more. Perhaps restore lost films or help recolourise content that only exists in black and white. The article was well written but I feel it could have gone more in depth into how the ML was done.
