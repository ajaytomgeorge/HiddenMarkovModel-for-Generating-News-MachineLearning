== COMMENTS

It is interesting to see how AI can touch every possible field with the correct data and training method. It is shown that GPT-3 is a powerful AI tool.
The article is a good summary of the project but doesn't go into detail of how it was the results (statistics) which could tell a little more about the AI.


The article describes the problem, the solution and the outcome greatly.
