==== AGENT

Google

==== GOAL

Predict live bus delay.

==== DATA

The real-time data on bus locations is collected from some transit agencies.
The dataset includes travel distance, traffic events and combination of time.

==== METHODS

At initial stage Google collects bus location data form public transportation agencies and uses it for training, then maps it to transport speeds on the route.
After that the model simulates the distance and time when a bus slows down and pulls over at a stop. The final output is the sum of the per-unit forecasts, and each unit¡¯s prediction is independent.
Also, a training model learns a hierarchy of representations of different streets, area and cities. Then sum the embeddings of a model location at various scales.
 
==== RESULTS

It provides bus routine and real time information over hundreds of major cities today.

==== COMMENTS

It is still not available for the majority of cities in the world. And it requires a huge amount data for training.
