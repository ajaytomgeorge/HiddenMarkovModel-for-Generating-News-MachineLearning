== GOAL

Better technique for cervical cancer screening

== DATA

3,545 patient-wise WSIs with 79,911 annotations from multiple hospitals and several imaging instruments

== METHODS

Supervised,  RNN, CNN, Logistic Regression

== RESULTS

88.5% true positive rate for highlighting the top 10 lesion cells on 447 positive slides. 
After deployment, the system recognizes a one giga-pixel WSI in about 1.5â€‰min.

== ISSUES

Are patients` consent obtained before using the data. 
The issue of results being biased towards people of particular ethinicity

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

The method is almost similar to approaches which have been consistently used in medical field.
They could have diversified the source of data
