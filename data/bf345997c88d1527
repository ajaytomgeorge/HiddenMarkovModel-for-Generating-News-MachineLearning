==== GOAL

To create a machine-learning algorithm that will create unique jazz solo pieces

==== DATA

Chords and notes in a positive sample data set of music the algorithm was to replicate.

==== METHODS

Snipets of solos were extracted and then using Markov chaining were used to string snippets
together.
To increase the variety in recombination of melodic ideas, they clustered similar abstract 
melodies together using the k-means clustering algorithm 

==== RESULTS

Jazz solo pieces were made of varying styles by taking different data sets from different artists

==== COMMENTS

Its interesting to see how music as varied as jazz can be replicated so easily by machine-learning algorithms
I'd be interested in hearing a jazz night and having some sort of Turing Test to see if people can decide if a
performance is played by a real human or machine-based
