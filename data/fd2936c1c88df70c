== AGENT

University of Illinois

== GOAL

Accelerate the protein engineering process

== DATA

They used genetic code from different protien stuctures as well as evlutionary data about specific protein structures 

== METHODS

They used a language and direct coupling model that were fed into an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

== RESULTS

The network outperformed current methods on several mutagenisis datasets and was used to engineer a protein called TEM-1 Beta-lactamase

== ISSUES

No issues

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

The teams employment of novel techniques to predict the genetic code of these proteins was very interesiting.
This will now allow them to study study improved enzyme catalysts and further our understanding of proteins, a major building block for life, as a whole.
The article was acurate and informative.
