== AGENT

Who did this machine-learning-related work (e.g., Netflix)

== GOAL

predict hospital-onset COVID-19 infections

== DATA

Used data from over 50,000 patients from April 2020 to April 2021. It collected data from patients â€˜in hospital

== METHODS

The research team combined machine learning with network analysis and developed a HOCI prediction framework with the help of routine electronic health data.

== RESULTS

Dynamic patient contact networks could be a strong predictor of transmission of respiratory viral infections in hospitals.

== ISSUES

Personal data being leaked 

== SCORE

Think this is very cool idea considering how much of the past two years have been consumed by covid in the last two years I feel this could be very beneficial to us. The data could help hospitals plan for surges in covid related hospitalises.
