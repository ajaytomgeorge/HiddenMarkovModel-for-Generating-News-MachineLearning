== AGENT

University of Glasgow researchers

== GOAL

System that could class the risk level of animal viruses to humans

== DATA

It used data that was encoded in the viral genome

== METHODS

An algorithm using Supervised Learning was used for this

== RESULTS

The system was able to predict accurately viruses, even new viruses

== ISSUES

Although the system is very accurate, there is still a chance that it may underestimate 
a virus that could then lead to more issues

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

This system has the power to help identify viruses before they could cause any real damage to people. 
I found it interesting that it could identify new viruses and how it could be implemented in keeping
the virus under control and how it could class the virus from low to high risk. I highly recommend having
a read of the article
