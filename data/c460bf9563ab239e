==== GOAL

The goal is to perform authorship identification with deep learning.

==== DATA

The dataset is obtained from theCenter for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems hosted by the Unviersity of California, Irvine.
The dataset contains 5000 news articles for 50 different journalism authors (100 texts per author).


==== METHODS

GloVe is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words.
In this project, GloVe pre-trained word vectors are used to encode the training articles and find the most representative vector that can represent the author.
Then the test articles are encoded usingthe same GloVe word vectors to obtain the most representative vector that can represent the article.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is also implemented to tackle this task.  GloVe pre-trained wordvectors are used to encode each word in the article.
Sentence level approach for RNN, The mean vector of each sentence is calculated and fed into the RNN model at each step.
This approach also captures the word / sentence sequence infor-mation since the RNN process is recurrent. 
Because that the average number of sentencesof all articles is around 15-20, this model does not suffer from the gradient valishing problem. 
The highest F1 score obtained is around 0.6.



==== RESULTS

In conclusion, this model in addition to capturing context information, also captures word / sentence sequence information and has the best performance with a 0.6F1score.
