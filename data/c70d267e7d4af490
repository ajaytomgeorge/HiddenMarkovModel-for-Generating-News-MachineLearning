==== GOAL

To teach a machine to draw using neaural networks.

==== DATA

They collected a dataset of over 70,00 sketches. Sketches 
are not pictures, but detailed vector representations of drawings
(at which point the user pressed the “pencil,” released where the 
line was drawn, and so on).

==== METHODS

Researchers have trained the Sequence-to-Sequence Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) using RNN as a coding/decoding mechanism.

==== RESULTS

Eventually, as befits the auto-encoder, the model received a latent vector 
that characterizes the original picture. Whereas the decoder can extract a 
drawing from this vector, you can change it and get new sketches. It can even
perform vector arithmetic to create new images.

==== COMMENTS

Although somewhat impractival and with no real applications at the current time,
I still think it is a great example of the potential of machine learning.
