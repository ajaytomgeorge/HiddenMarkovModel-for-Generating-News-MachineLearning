==== AGENT



Engineers at Beihang University and Microsoft China



==== GOAL


They developed a bot that comments on online news articles, called "DeepCom".


The intention is to drive traffic to the comments section of articles and engage 
humans in debates.

==== DATA



They got their data from a Chinese dataset of articles from the Chinese website 
"Tencent News" and an English dataset of "Yahoo News" articles.



==== METHODS



They trained one neural network to "read" articles and get the most important 
points from it. Another neural network was trained to then generate the comment 
based on the output of the first network.


==== RESULTS



The article does not mention results, but rather the risks involved with making a 
commenter bot and that while it is mentioned that there are risks in the paper this 
article is based on, the authors of the paper don't say how these risks can be 
mitigated.


==== COMMENTS



The article is quite critical of bots that comment on articles or in social media, 
referring to the high number of fake accounts on social media and how these try 
spreading political propaganda.
The author of the article also criticises that potential biases of the bot are not 
addressed in the paper. 
The article does not go into technical detail of the neural networks or the results 
achieved.
