==== AGENT
A team from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
==== GOAL
A new system for better predicting health outcomes for Cardiovascualar patients
==== DATA
The system, called “RiskCardio,” focuses on patients who have survived an acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS). Using just the first 15 minutes of a patient's raw electrocardiogram 
(ECG) signal, the tool produces a score that places patients into different risk categories. 
RiskCardio’s high-risk patients — patients in the top quartile — were nearly seven times more 
likely to die of cardiovascular death when compared to the low-risk group in the bottom quartile. 
By comparison, patients identified as high risk by the most common existing risk metrics were only 
three times more likely to suffer an adverse event compared to their low-risk counterparts. 
==== METHODS
To get the model up and running, the team first separated each patient's signal into a 
collection of adjacent heart beats. They then assigned a label — i.e., whether or not the 
patient died of cardiovascular death — to each set of adjacent heartbeats. The researchers 
trained the model to classify each pair of adjacent heartbeats to its patient outcome: Heartbeats 
from patients who died were labeled “risky,” while heartbeats from patients who survived were 
labeled “normal.” 
==== RESULTS
They measured how much more likely a patient would suffer from cardiovascular death as a 
high-risk patient when compared to a set of low-risk patients. They found that in 
roughly 1,250 post-ACS patients, 28 would die of cardiovascular death within a year. 
Using the proposed risk score, 19 of those 28 patients were classified as high-risk.
==== COMMENTS
How effective could this approach be seen as all bodies are different? How accurate is it? What is the
margin of error?
