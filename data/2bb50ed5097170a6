==== AGENT

Google (Google Maps).

==== GOAL

Prediciting bus traffic delays in real-time.

==== DATA

Attained real-time data on bus locations from some transit agencies.

==== METHODS

The model creation process begins by gathering bus location data from public transportation agencies for training data, then aligning that to car speeds on the route. The sequence model then accounts for each anticipated stop or reduction in speed, such as the time and distance a bus needs to slow down and pull over at a bus stop.

==== RESULTS

Google can accurately provide predictions without a need to rely on bus schedules provided by public transportation agencies.

==== COMMENTS

Great application of innovation for daily bus commuters.
