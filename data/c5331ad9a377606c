== AGENT
The U.S Army

== GOAL
To put artificial intelligence in the driver’s seat of its ground vehicles

== DATA
A “gradient” method, where agents can maximize for many objectives ranging from object avoidance, speed or human safety.

== METHODS
Reinforcement Learning

== RESULTS
Training data will, byte-for-byte, become more valuable and useful.

== ISSUES
Trying to save lives by automation instead of risking human lives seems like a good idea at first, but if two armies starts fighting with just automation,
doesn't that make war pointless in a sense? 

== SCORE
6

== COMMENTS
It's cool that armies are trying to save lives.
