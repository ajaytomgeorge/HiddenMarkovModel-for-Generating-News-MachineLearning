Dr Sebastiano Massaro, Associate Professor of Organisational Neuroscience at the University of Surrey

==== GOAL

develop a neural network approach that can accurately identify congestive heart failure

==== DATA

large publicly available ECG datasets featuring subjects with CHF as well as healthy, non-arrhythmic hearts

==== METHODS

used a combination of advanced signal processing and machine learning tools on raw ECG signals

==== RESULTS

They were able to accurately identify congestive heart failure with 100% accuracy through analysis of just one raw electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat

==== COMMENTS

100% accuracy from a single heartbeat allows for early intervention which will in turn ease the pressure on hospitals.
