==== AGENT

MIT and the University of California at San Diego

==== GOAL

Use machine learning to trace IP hijacks back to serial hijackers.

==== DATA

data was procured from several yearsâ€™ worth of network operator mailing lists, as well as 
historical BGP data taken every five minutes from the global routing table.

==== METHODS

The team extrapolated certain traits and qualities that were commonly displayed during 
the observation of cyber criminals. It was noted that many behaviors were repeated 
frequently and could be used to pinpoint offenders. More specific qualities were then 
used in order to identify if a hijacker was a repeat or serial offender.
Putting this iformation together the team were able to train their program to identify 
serial hijackers and suspicious activity that can be commonly seen during these activities.

==== RESULTS

The system was able to identify roughly 800 suspicious networks along with some serial 
offenders.
They will present their paper at the ACM Internet Measurement Conference in Amsterdam in
October highlighting their findings.

==== COMMENTS

This system, in my opinion will have a great impact on preemptive measures against cyber 
attacks.
