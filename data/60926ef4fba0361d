==== AGENT

UK National Grid ESO in conjunction with the Alan Turing Institute

==== GOAL

The goal was to increase the amount of solar energy input by improving weather forecasting with machine learning.

==== DATA

According to the article historical data temperature and solar irradiance. 

==== METHODS

They take 80 input variables and use them to find 80 possible weather forecasts, the average of these 80 forecasrs is 
taken as the new solar generation forecast.

==== RESULTS

The ESO's solar forecasting was improved by 33%. 

==== COMMENTS

The article gave very little technical detail and failed to show what impact this new technology would actually have
on renewable energy.
