== GOAL

Data driven approach to analyse Biomass waste-derived porous carbons (BWDPCs) and its efficacy to absorb CO2

== DATA

The team conducted a literature review and selected 76 publications describing both the synthesis and performance of various BWDPCs. After curation, these papers provided over 500 data points

== METHODS

Gradient boosting decision trees

== RESULTS

The gradient boosting decision trees had the best predictive performance with R2 of 0.98 and 0.84 on the training and test data, respectively

== ISSUES

Non mentioned

== SCORE 

8. Climate change being one of the biggest existential threads, this kind of applications are always welcome to get us close to a more circular economy

== COMMENTS

The data collection is clever, they relied on prior information based on peer-reviewed research papers. The article misses a lot of information but it has the research paper attached to do a deep dive. I believe this is a very impactful way of using AI to solve the biggest problems of humanity.
