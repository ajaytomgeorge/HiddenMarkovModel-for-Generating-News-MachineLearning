==== GOAL

Distillation of crop models to learn plant physiology theories using machine learning models.

==== DATA

Generated datasets fed to Convolutional Neural Networks, also many crop information on paddy rice was used since rice is one 
of the most common crops grown in many Asian countries. Meterological data was acquired for the use of this as well.
Simulations of paddy rice was also used as part of the dataset.
132,460 datasets were obtained.

==== METHODS

Since it is difficult to collect big data on crop growth, a generated dataset was fed into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
for distillation of crop models.
Simulated paddy rice data and real paddy rice data was used along with some other crop growth generated data as part of the data set.
Simulation Model for Rice-Weather relations (SIMRIW) was used to simute potential growth and yeild of irrigated rice with factors including 
weather, temperature, solar radiation and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.
The algorithms for this can be viewed in the article. Meterological data was acquired to assist with this.
For the crop models using CNN, a 3x3 pixel convolution layer with a stride of 1x1 pixel in both horizontal and vertical directions 
and padding of 2x2 pixels was used. This mapped single channel in the input to 32 feature maps, etc.
There was a second layer and so so, the error was then calculated and weights adjusted.
Meterological data was put in a 2D array and fed into the CNN to obtain predictions of the grain yield as weather, temp, etc would affect 
crop growth.
This data was then finally evaluated using graphs and mapping (can be seen in article).

==== RESULTS

The data was graphed and a visual mapping of the data was done to see the results. But used mostly only simulated data 
so it's difficult to know if it would work with real world examples, although, this is very helpful for testing theories 
on crop growth and other related plant relations.

==== COMMENTS

This research is very interesting as it can help with crop growth and theories. But I think because of the simulated 
data primarily being used along with the fact that most of the data was on paddy rice. It's difficult to tell if this would be 
accurate enough with real world examples. But this field of research can definitely help improve crop growth.
