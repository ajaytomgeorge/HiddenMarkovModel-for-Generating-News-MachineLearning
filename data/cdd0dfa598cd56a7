== GOAL

Traffic Prediction for Intelligent Transportation System using Machine Learning.

== DATA

Real-time traffic data and historical data were collected from various sensor sources, including inductive loops, radars, cameras, mobile Global Positioning System, crowdsourcing, social media.

== METHODS

Intelligent Transportation System (ITSs), Deep learning, Decision Tree Algorithm (DT) and Random forest algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

== RESULTS

The accuracy of the Traffic prediction result is more in the Random forest algorithm compared to the Decision Tree Algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

== ISSUES

The proposed algorithm also offers higher precision than existing algorithms and also improves complexity issues across the entire data set.


== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

Since the accuracy rate is ninety percentage, the proposed module has to be more accurate for traffic prediction. The method used is not new since already many traffic prediction machine learning projects are existing in the real world.Â
