==== AGENT

Kinetica, Nvidia and Jade Greenberg of Pascack Hills High School

==== GOAL

detecting the presence of varroa mitesâ€™ in bee conlonies and and what they can do to help.

==== DATA

They installed a camera and captured photos every 10 seconds of the hive and placed sensors to monitor the temperature and humidity of the hive.

==== METHODS

they used Nvidias machine learning to detect the presence of varroa mites on bees. they used supervised learning to detect which frames had the mites in them.
==== RESULTS

it is still in the prototype stage and its currently ongoing. 

==== COMMENTS
Im skeptical what the solution to this will be as it is still ongoing. they only seem to have a small sample set and im not sure how accurate it will be.
