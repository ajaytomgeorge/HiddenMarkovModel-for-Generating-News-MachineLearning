== GOAL
Machine Learning to Predict Cardiac Amyloidosis 

==DATA
Data analysis was initiated by searching for diagnosed cases of CA in extracted medical records.This is	 a summary of the entire construction process of the training data set.
The processing of each type of variable (text/categorical/numeric) was carried out separately to be treated in a particular way according to their nature.

== METHODS
Supervised 

== RESULTS
The use of artificial intelligence is considered very useful in supporting medical decision-making. However, it is necessary to externally validate the use of algorithms as a diagnostic test as well as the cost-effectiveness of its implementation. 

== ISSUES
For this, prospective studies are necessary for which the effectiveness of the algorithm is tested, evaluating the care, economic and social impact. In the case of CA, it will be carried out in the next phase of the investigation.
