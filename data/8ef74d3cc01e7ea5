== GOAL

To find mutations in similar genome sequences of cancer samples, To spot cancerous mutations in non-unique parts of the genome.

== DATA

The researchers developed a list of genome regions known to be similar to other regions and then using them to teach a machine learning algorithm how to recognize them.

== METHODS

Developing a list of genome regions known to be similar to other regions and then using them to teach a machine-learning algorithm how to recognize them. Researchers then used the algorithm to spot mutations in different tissuesâ€”2,658 samples from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genome dataset.
Due to the use of a dataset to determine how the results this is a method of unsupervised learning through classification

== RESULTS

The researchers uncovered mutations in 1,744 coding sequences along with thousands of other mutations in non-coding sequences. They also found that their algorithm had a false discovery rate of approximately 7% and a validation rate of more than 80%.

== ISSUES

Overall I did not find any issues in this report and how the article was reported.

== SCORE


8

== COMMENTS

Overall I found this algorithm and method of using a supervised based machine learning algorithm do discover cancerous mutations to be extremely interesting and it was a great way to use existing data which although has been tested was mostly structured to finding the more common mutations and this article builds upon the previous method excellently.
If I was to undertake this project I would not make any changes as I believe this is a very useful method and proved its success through its high validation rate of 80%.
