== GOAL

Evaluating the  changes in Urban Traffic Congestion due to Rainfall using ICC Model.

== DATA

The dataset is collected from Shenzhen Meteorological Database - https://data.szmb.gov.cn/


== METHODS

Point Kernel density method, Linear Kernel density method, DBSCAN algorithm, k-means algorithm


== RESULTS

Finding Citizens Travel Patterns, Influence on road speed and Traffic congestion due to rainfall.

== ISSUES

Accuracy is not that great as the results of ICC model is based on road network structure, roads weight instead it should use actual traffic data of urban to increase accuracy
== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

This article not only helps to detect the influence of traffic congestion due to rainfall, but also with these results we will help us to identify the areas that has poor drainage system areas.

Current article research categorises the data into weekdays and weekends. But I would also recommend to consider National Holidays also as the traffic movements are higher.
