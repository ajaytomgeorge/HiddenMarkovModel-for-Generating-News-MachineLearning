== AGENT

Google

== GOAL

Create a better attribution model for Google Ads that allow companies to see the path users take to get to the add

== DATA

Clicks and video engagements — on your Search (including Shopping), YouTube, and Display ads in Google Ads

== METHODS

Pattern recognition "by comparing the paths of customers who convert to the paths of customers who don’t"

== RESULTS

A model that will display ads based on the users journey instead of the last-click model

== ISSUES

While Google says this respects user privacy it obviously does not. It now tracks the path a user took
to get to the add, which is even more data than before.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

It does not surprise me that Google is innovating on ways to sell user data in any way that it can. The most
surprising thing is that they were not using more user data besides last click before this.
