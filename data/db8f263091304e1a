==== GOAL

Predict the weather using machine learning.

==== DATA

Weather Underground's free tier API web service.

==== METHODS

They used machine learning to predict weather forecasts.

==== RESULTS

It worked reasonably well.

==== COMMENTS

Machine learning to predict the weather is an extremely hard task to do as there are just too many variables however, with the dawn of quantum computing the leaps that may be possible will enable us to accurately predict the weather to within a degree that could open up a new paradigm to be explored by society.
