== AGENT

MIT CSAIL and Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health

== GOAL

To predict new drug combinations to fight Covid-19

== DATA

Used existing data from other diseases. Data was in the form of drug-target interaction and drug-drug synergy.

== METHODS

Unsupervised learning. Used two models, one to learn drug-target interaction and one to learn drug-drug synergy.
These two models would then combine their knowledge to find new synergies.

== RESULTS

Found two new drug combinations: remdesivir and reserpine, as well as remdesivir and IQ-1S

== ISSUES

The data needs real tests done on humans before it can be verified, so the results may not end up being useful or accurate.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I thought it was interesting because it shined some light on potential applications of machine learning on an
important, ever-present and current issue, which is finding treatments for new diseases using existing data as
data specifically pertaining to new diseases is hard to come by. The reporting in the press could have gone into
more detail as to what data was used and how in order to remove ambiguity.
