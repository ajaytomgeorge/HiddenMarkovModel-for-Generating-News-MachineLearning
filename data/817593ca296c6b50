== AGENT

Fetch.ai

== GOAL

For AI to create digital art

== DATA

The algorithm learned in the form of user submitted random patterns.
These patterns were submitted by users who took part in the event and created random images

== METHODS

The algorithm was an unsupervised system that took the data to create the NFTs

== RESULTS

The data was used to create unique images that were made by the AI algorithm 

== ISSUES

One issue I see with this is there being an unnecessary increase in how much people will sell the NFTs for

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I found it interesting that the AI was able to create unique images everytime from the supplyed images of
random sketches. This method of having AI create art is new and is still being worked on by Fetch.ai
