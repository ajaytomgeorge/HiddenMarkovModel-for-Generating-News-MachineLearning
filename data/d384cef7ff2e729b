== GOAL

Predict protein patterns and improve enzyme stability, solubility and function

== DATA

Databases of protein sequences and structures and databases of protein stability and solubility.
There are many high quality databases used such as the UniProtKB database of protein sequences. 

== METHODS

Mostly supervised learning but some semi-supervised learning

== RESULTS

Many impressive algorithms and techniques have been developed but there is still a lot of research
yet to be done. There is a lack of homogeneous and consistent data sets of high quality for training
and validation

== ISSUES

More data required as machine learning has only recently been used in this field of research.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

Was cool to see machine learning application in biology and not just computing.
