CMO from IDG

== GOAL

have machine learning lead to better and longer-lasting love matches

== DATA

human psychology and relationship research

== METHODS

The algorithm uses process of generating behavioural data using machine learning models to ultimately offer more personalised recommendations to its users.
The company now runs 20 affinity models in its efforts to improve matches, capturing data on things like photo features, user preferences, site usage and profile content.
The company also uses a CS2 distribution algorithm to increase match satisfaction across the user base.

== RESULTS

Algorithm that figures out if 2 people are compatible or not.

== ISSUES

The algorithm can figure out the compatability of 2 people but it can't predict if they'll be attracted to eachother or not.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

Very strange but cool project. Never thought that machine learning would be used by dating apps.
There's still alot of work to be done to make this an effective algorithm. 
The reporting was very clear and easy to follow they managed to inlcude all the major points about the project.
