== GOAL

Optimizing the testing of incoming travellers for COVID-19 involves predicting those who are most likely to test positive. A machine-learning algorithm for targeted testing has been implemented at the Greek border.

== DATA
They have used the data of test reports of incoming travellers to Greece.

== METHODS

Reinforcement learning

== RESULTS

The algorithm, which is built on a method called reinforcement learning, markedly increased the efficiency of testing for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, and contributed to Greeceâ€™s ability to keep its borders open safely. The work also provides a clear warning about the shortcomings of the comparatively blunt policy tools that most other countries continue to use.

==COMMENTS

It is interesting and it is a efficient algorithm as the authority can track the spread of covid-19 virus and can open the borders safely
