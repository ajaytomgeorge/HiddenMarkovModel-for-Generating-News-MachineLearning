== AGENT

Researchers at MIT

== GOAL

To quickly and efficiently approximate Matrix Multiplication to increase the speed of machine learning.

== DATA

This project usess the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

== METHODS

The project proposes a collection of efficient hashing functions rather than the standard multiply-add operations typically used in Approximate Matrix Multiplications. 

== RESULTS

The MADDNESS algorithm was compared to six different AMM algorithms, and proved to be approximately 10 times faster than the other algorithms, though it does have an accuracy tradeoff. 

== ISSUES

There is some less created by using this method, but the researchers proved it had an upper bound that was offset by the speed increase.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS
The code and raw numerical results are all publicly available, which is highly commendable. 
This research also shows sigficant improvements over any other type of AMM available at the moment, which is a big step forward to reduce computation required for typical matrix multiplication. This could have a large impact on machine learning model runtimes.
