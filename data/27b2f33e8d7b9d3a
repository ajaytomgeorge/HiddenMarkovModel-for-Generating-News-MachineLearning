==Agent
medRxiv

==Goal
A real-time framework using patient contact networks to predict hospital-onset COVID-19 infections using Machine Learning.

==Data
The research team trained and tested the HOCI framework using over 50,000 patients admitted to a UK National Health Service (NHS).

==Methods
Predictive Model, Supervised Learning

==Results
The results showed that dynamic patient contact networks could be a strong predictor of transmission of respiratory viral infections 
in hospitals. Thus, the integration of these networks in clinical care could improve individualized prevention of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as well as early diagnosis.

==Comments
With no end in sight to the COVID-19 pandemic, this new predictive framework and contact risk factors offer a 
valuable tool to assist identification of potential HOCI cases across various epidemic and endemic periods.
