== AGENT

scientists like Abdul-Rahman, Chief of Medical Genetics at the University of Mississippi

== GOAL

They making potential diagnoses for rare genetic diseases to help physicians by there work

== DATA

they use data which they get from its use and the original data set is the symptoms of the diseases

== METHODS

supervised ML and face recognition

== RESULTS

At the example it helped the physician to order further test to prove the suggestion. Overall is the project still running and does not have a final result

== ISSUES

The algorithm recommends a disease everytime even tough there could be none.
There was no test phase to prove the algorithm.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

It is an interesting new helpful algorithm that can support the physicans to minimize the suffering of people with rare deseases and get them their medication earlier. 
Also the required experience with the app is an problem but the idea is good and it needs simply more data and testing to conquer the problems.
The reporting seemed reasonable and solid
