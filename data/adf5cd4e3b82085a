==== AGENT
Engineers at Beihang University and Microsoft China
==== GOAL
Create a news bot that comments on popular news articles the same way a human would.
==== DATA
The system is based on how humans typically consume news online: We're likely to read the headline, 
take away a few key points, and write a comment based on the points that are most interesting to 
usâ€”or support or contest them based on our own personal views.
==== METHODS
The system is made up of two neural networks: a reading network that "comprehends" an article and 
picks out important points, and a generation network that writes a comment based on those points and 
the title of the article.
==== RESULTS
The researchers successfully created a bot that reads and interprets news articles and can provide
human like comments on the articles.
