All information came from https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/machine-learning-predicts-electron-densities-with-dft-accuracy/4010448.article.

==== AGENT

Cl√©mence Corminboeuf, Michele Ceriotti and colleagues at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology lead the project.

==== GOAL

The team's goal was to develop a machine learning model that can predict the electron density from only atomic coordiantes.

==== DATA

The machine learning model relied heavily on a vast training set of small molecule dimers. The dimers had their electron density represented by basis sets (similar to normal computational chemistry calculations).

==== METHODS

A machine learning model was trained on density functional computed electron densities of small dimers. The model was then tested on its ability to predict electron densities of chemically difference & far larger systems. 

==== RESULTS

The model predicted the electron density of a system within 1.4%. This prediction was achieved far quicker than standard models.

==== COMMENTS

The article's target reader would need extensive knowledge of chemistry to understand the theory referred to, but a knowledge of machine learning would allow the reader to understand the models used & the implication of the results.
