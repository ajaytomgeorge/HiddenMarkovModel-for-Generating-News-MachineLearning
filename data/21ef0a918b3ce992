== GOAL

Solve a Rubik's Cube with a deep learning algorithm - DeepCubeA

== DATA

Goal state scrambled to random positions with all states in between used to train

== METHODS

Deep learning was accomplished through unsupervised learning in isolation. A* was used to minimize the amount of moves to reach goal state.

== RESULTS

The DeepCubeA algorithm reaches the goal state in the least possible amount of moves 60.3% of the time and can solve 100% of test configurations. It usually takes around 20 moves to solve.

== ISSUES

I don't believe there to be any issues in the research or reporting of this algorithm. The researchers are honest about how small this algorithm is in the grand scheme of AI systems, but believe that it is an important step nevertheless.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I found the usage of A* to be interesting in pressing the algorithm to finish the problem under a time limit.
