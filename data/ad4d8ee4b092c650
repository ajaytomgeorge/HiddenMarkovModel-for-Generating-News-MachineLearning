== AGENT
Google
== GOAL
Use machine learning to pass Turing tests in the forms of CAPTCHAs
== DATA
CAPTCHA data from human interaction on Google sites was used to teach a machine to beat Google's own CAPTCHAs
== METHODS
Support Vector Machines
== RESULTS
Google were able to use machine learning combined with user data collected from their reCAPTCHA service to train and pass their CAPTCHA checks.
They did so with an accuracy of 99.8%, while human users had a success rate of only 33%. 
Over the years, this has led to an increase in difficulty in CAPTCHAS to try and stay ahead of the machines.
Machines are capable of solving image based, text based and even audio based CAPTCHAs.
== ISSUES
The main issue with this work is that it lead to annoying people with harder CAPTCHAs.
Unfortunately this is a necessary evil for the internet that we must put up with. 
The article does somewhat sensationalise the issue, but I expected no less from the Verge.

== COMMENTS
This article highlights how fast machines are learning to pass our so-called Turing tests used to authenticate human interactions on websites.
In particular, it shows that the machines have become more efficient at solving these CAPTCHAs than the average person.
It raises interesting questions, concerns, and insights about the future/progression of CAPTCHAs and how they've evolved over time.
For example, CAPTCHA games which rely on simple games that can be universally understood by all people across cultural and linguistic boundaries are particularly interesting in concept, but also highlight a significant challenge in CAPTCHA design.
To create something abstract and with as little instruction given to a user to make it hard for a machine to interpret, but needs to be understandable to as many people as possible for it to be useful for authentication.
