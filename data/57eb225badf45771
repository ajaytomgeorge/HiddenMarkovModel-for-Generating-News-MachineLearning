==== AGENT

eHarmony is an online dating site.

==== GOAL

The goal of eHarmony is to use the personal information that clients provide and to use machine learning algorithms
to find a romantic match from the client.

==== DATA

29 different dimensions of personality are collected from each user of the website in the form of a questionnaire.
There are 436 questions in the questionnaire and about 15,000 different people take the questionnaire each day.

==== METHODS

eHarmony uses integer optimisation in its matching algorithm. The algorithm works by assigning a compatibility
score to pairs of people on the website, ranging between 1 and 5. Each person should match to one other person
using the mathematical constraint x1 + x2 + x3 = 1. Logistic regression is then used on pairs of users differences
to predict compatibility. In order to reduce the size of the data only people from the surrounding area are considered
who have compatibility scores listed in the data set. Next the absolute difference is computed on the features for the
1475 pairs. Then a logistic regression model is trained on the differences. A low threshold for the logistic model is
used which generates a high proportion of false positives but also gets a high proportion of true positives. The classification
matrix for a threshold equal to 0.2 generates a successful matching rate of 29%, which is very high for an online dating sit.

==== RESULTS

Since 2000 eHarmony has generated over $1 billion dollars in revenue and in 2012 nearly 4% of US marriages were as a result of
eHarmony.


==== COMMENTS

The online dating site eHarmony has created an enormously profitable business using quite a simple and straight forward type of
machine learning, Linear Regression.
