== AGENT

Google

== GOAL

Use AI to design AI chips quicker than a human

== DATA

10,000 chip floor plans of varying quality.

== METHODS

A reinforcement learning algorithm was used to train the model. Each design in the dataset was tagged with a specific "reward" function based on metrics like length of wire required and power usage. The algorithm can use this to distinguish between good and bad designs and generate its own.

== RESULTS

The designs are very different to how a human would design a chip. The AI designed chips seem to have components placed at random. They have been described as "comparable or superior" but can be generated much faster.

== ISSUES

The article doesn't contain any hard result data just quotes from Google.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

The concept of computers designing themselves has been present in Sci-Fi for years, generally in a negative world ending light. The reality of this however is that we will see more advanced hardware at a much quicker rate than if humans were designing these chips. The article highlights this and Google's breakthrough could be the beginning of fully autonomous designs for computer hardware.
