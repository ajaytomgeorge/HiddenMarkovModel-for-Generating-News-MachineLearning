==== GOAL

A study on Machine Learning based algorithms for prediction of motorcycle crash severity.

==== DATA

Data was obtained from the Traffic and Transportation Engineering Division of Building and Road Research Institute (BRRI) of 
the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Ghana. The crash data for motorcycles has four types of injury severities.
Fatal Injury (F), Hospitalized (H), Not-Hospitalized (I) and Damage with no death or injury (D).
The data includes motorcycle crashes occuring in Ghana from JAN 2011 - DEC 2015.

==== METHODS

The Machine Learning model used Classification as there are four types of severity to choose from, this means that 
the Machine Learning algorithm was supervised and acts more like a forecaster to predict as best as possible whether 
something fits in a severity type or another. 
A J48 Decision Tree Classifier was used and is open-source. This algorithm uses the devide and conquer strategy to solve 
the learning problem in grouping the different accidents. 
Random Forest was also implemented along with Instance-based learning with parameter k (K-nearest neighbours) which is a lazy-learning 
algorithm. The models were then validated and put in a table to check the accuracy of it.

==== RESULTS

The performance of the model was able to handled outliers and missing values well. It was able to identify and predict the response varialbes, 
which in turn helped better classify the different motorcycle crashes. In some experimental results it had a 73.64% accuracy of correctly identify 
the correct severity levels, but over time this accuracy should increase.

==== COMMENTS

Motorcycle accidents happen very often, I can see this helping to better deduce what happens in these accidents and 
to look for patterns in them to better understand why some accidents have a certain severity compared to others.
