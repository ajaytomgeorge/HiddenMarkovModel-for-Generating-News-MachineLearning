== AGENT

Scientists on a global scale. 

== GOAL

To use machine learning in sequence data analysis and improve data processing capabilities and generate valuable biological information

== DATA

Data stored in DNA sequenced which are connected by four kinds of deoxyribonucleotides (bases). 

== METHODS

Many different ones, e.g. surpervised learning for DNA sequence classification, unsupervised learning for cluster analysis.

== RESULTS

DNA data mining is still a very new field, but strides have been made and the continued advancement in life science and hardware technology will open up plenty more possiblities.  

== ISSUES

Even if the development of the technology reaches the point where it is sufficient for functional DNA data mining, the practicality of the method is still a question mark, due 

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

Data mining with DNA is just an incredible concept. (Even more black magic than ice cubes out of the fridge door)
