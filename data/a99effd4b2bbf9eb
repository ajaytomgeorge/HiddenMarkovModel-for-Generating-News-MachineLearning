== GOAL

To train a robot to recognise and find items when they are lost/hidden

== DATA

If the robot was given all the camera data and RF measurements to the reinforcement learning algorithm, it would have overwhelmed the system. 
Instead they used a method a GPS uses to consolidate data from satellites, they summarized the RF measurements and limited the visual data to the area right in front of the robot.

== METHODS

The researchers used reinforcement learning to train a neural network that can optimize the robot’s trajectory to the object.
In reinforcement learning, the algorithm is trained through trial and error with a reward system.

The system, RFusion, is a robotic arm with a camera and radio frequency (RF) antenna attached to its gripper.
It fuses signals from the antenna with visual input from the camera to locate and retrieve an item.

The robotic arm automatically zeroes-in on the object’s exact location, moves the items on top of it, grasps the object,
and verifies that it picked up the right thing

== RESULTS

Their approach worked well, the robot had a 96 percent success rate when retrieving objects that were fully hidden under a pile.

== ISSUES

I had no issues with the news article, it was inspiring and I had no real issues with the idea.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

I thought this news article was pretty cool, it leads way to the posibility of robots being very advanced.
In this case it uses high level technology and science to find objects a human couldn't find using their own abilities.
