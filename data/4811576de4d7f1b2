==== GOAL

The researchers were trying to training a new machine learning AI tool to recognise differences in plant structure
between healthy plants and un-healthy plants.

==== DATA

They used a 3-D laser scanner to scan 54 tomato and tobacco plants grown in a variety of conditions.

==== METHODS

The researchers used supervised learning to identify the healthy plants so the software could learn to automatically
recognise leaves and shoots on the plants.

==== RESULTS

The software was succesful in separating stems from leaves with a 97.8% accuracy

==== COMMENTS

The researchers were only succesful with differentiating stems from leaves according to the article and had a very small
database with two specific plants. They are planning on making the software open source so others can carry on their research.
They hope this will increase crop production.
