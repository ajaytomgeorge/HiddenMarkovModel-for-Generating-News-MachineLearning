== AGENT
Kevin Chance, Pharma Times

== GOAL
To show how ML and modelling can help the biopharma industry

== DATA
Large aggregate body of data from a myriad of sources (not specified) 

== METHODS
As explained in the data section, predictive modelling powered by ML and data science could help to predict the behaviour and interactions of various drug candidates and how they perform in cell culture, or define what the chromatography parameters should be.

== RESULTS
The result of the article was that biopharma industry have a hard time integrating new technologies and that implementing ML and predictive modelling will require ample investment, innovation and a mindset shift, however it will enable the biopharma industry to deliver better medicines, faster, more accessible, and with greater personalisation

== ISSUES
No particular issues with the article itself, it was quite complicated bringing it a lot of pharmaceutical terms which most people wouldn't understand, and it didn't go into much detail regarding ML and how this will be implemented and what data is being used

== SCORE
6

== COMMENTS
How ML and my course in general can improve the Pharma industry is very interesting and not an area I would expect CS to help out.
