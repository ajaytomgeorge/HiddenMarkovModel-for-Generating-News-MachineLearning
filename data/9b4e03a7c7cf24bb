== GOAL
Create self-aware and self-healing computer systems to counter cyber attacks.
== DATA
The inputs that a system takes, even those that are not used by the part of the system that is the observer.
== METHODS
The system modifies pre-existing, non-essential data to create a signal that the parts of the system can verify.
== RESULTS
The method seems successful, as a startup created by the researchers has been acquired by a larger company to impliment their algorithm.
== ISSUES
The data that the algorithm modifies might be incorrectly identified as non-essential and modifying it could create issues for the system.
== SCORE
5
== COMMENTS
The method that is in use by the algorithm to identify anomalies is interesting, as well as being able to self-heal when an anomaly is detected. The method of using un-used data to verify data seems promising to me.
