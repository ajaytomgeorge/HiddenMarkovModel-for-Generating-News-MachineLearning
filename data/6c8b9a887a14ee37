====GOAL 

Understanding climate change 

====DATA 

Data was taken from methane emission from the oceans. 

====METHOD 

Recorded where was emitting the most methane. 

====RESULTS 

It was found that shallow coastal waters emitted 50% of the oceans methane gas even do these regions only make up 5% of the ocean area, this is because methane can seep out of natural gas reservoirs. 

====COMMENTS 

This research is critical in understanding climate change and areas which are the root cause.
