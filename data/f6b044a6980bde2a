==== AGENT

reCAPTCHA

==== GOAL

Create accurate word detection/ Improve street object detection

==== DATA

By having people prove that they aren't a robot by putting in data that would distinguish them from bots, such
as word recognition in unusual scenarios.

==== METHODS

Got users of websites to enter two words that are difficult to interpret when creating an account on websites.

==== RESULTS

Optical character detection is very accurate now with this training and now object detection is being utilized
so it has proven successful as it is still being used for another form of training.

==== COMMENTS

The story goes into detail on how people trained AIs to recognise characters and now objects, but it feels like a 
hit piece on the methods used rather than noting the convieniences that it brings. Such as better object detection
for self driving cars
