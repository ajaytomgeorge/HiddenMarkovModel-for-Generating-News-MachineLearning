== AGENT

Edgecase

== GOAL

Provide a better shopper experience while online shopping.

== DATA

Took data from what a regular shopping experience is like, i.e questions asked by customers to staff.

== METHODS

A combination of machine learning and human curation.

== RESULTS

Increase of sales for online retailers, better shopping experience for their customers through easier filtering and interaction with the site. The website was able to improve conversation rates for Urban Decay by 16 percent.

== ISSUES

The report of 16% increase could have also been due to external factors such as a sale or new release, not just because of the Edgecase system.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

I thought it was interesting because the customer can specify the type of clothing or item it wants with certain attributes while the website updates instantly.
