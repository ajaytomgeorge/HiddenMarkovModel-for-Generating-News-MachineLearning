==== GOAL

To recreate lifelike motion using just a single frame of a persons face and a driving 
sequence.

==== DATA

The system requires a single frame of the persons face as well as a driving video which 
is used to decide the motions of the single frame image.

==== METHODS

This program uses a Generative Adversarial Network. This means the system generation the 
sequence has to fool another program it is pitted against into thinking that the face 
produced is an authentic human being and not just a rendering of one. The second system 
is doing the authenticating and will not let the first system produce an output unless it 
is reasonably certain that it is an actual human face.

==== RESULTS

The results of this project are amazing with a single frame and a driving sequence the 
team were able to achieve outputs of extremely convincing 'fake humans'. Considering the 
little amount of data required for these systems to output a false human of this quality 
is astounding.

==== COMMENTS

This technology, I feel, could be used in countless aplications related to facial 
recognition and other image manipulation/translation softwares.
