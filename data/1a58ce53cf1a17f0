For testing results they used the Chictopia10k [Xiaodan Liang, Si Liu, Xiaohui Shen, Jianchao Yang, Luoqi Liu, Jian Dong, Liang Lin, and Shuicheng Yan. Deep human parsing with active template regression. Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on, 2015. 2, 3, 6 ] dataset for all experiments. They used 15, 930 images to train the generators, and 12, 744 to train the fashionability classifier. We use the procedure described in Sec. 3.2 to prepare positive and negative examples for training the fashionability classifier. They evaluated on 3,240 such unfashionable examples. All of them are real world examples==== METHODSTheir model consists of a deep image generation neural network that learns to synthesize clothing conditioned on learned per-garment encodings. The latent encodings are explicitly factorized according to shape and texture, thereby allowing direct edits for both fit/presentation and color/patterns/material, respectively. They have shown how to bootstrap Web photos to automatically train a fashionability model, and develop an activation maximization-style approach to transform the input image into its more fashionable self.  The edits suggested range from swapping in a new garment to tweaking its color, how it is worn (e.g., rolling up sleeves), or its fit (e.g., making pants baggier). They found the gradient step approach to be at least as effective to achieve gradual edits==== RESULTSFacebook++ introduced the minimal fashion edit problem. Minimal edits are motivated by consumers’ need to tweak existing wardrobes and designers’ desire to use familiar clothing as a springboard for inspiration. They introduced a novel image generation framework to optimize and display minimal edits yielding more fashionable outfits, accounting for essential technical issues of locality, scalable supervision, and flexible manipulation control. Their results are quite promising, both in terms of quantitative measures and human judge opinions. In future work, they plan to broaden the composition of the training source, e.g., using wider social media platforms like Instagram, bias an edit towards an available inventory, or generate improvements conditioned on an individual’s preferred style or occasion.==== COMMENTSThis is an innovative experiment which is useful in various types of sectors. All age groups would be attracted to such a feature that would help people to dress better. One thing to look into is the data set, they should be able to provide data set that will avoid showcasing irrelevant styles/ways of wearing an outfit. This is avoid the failure cases where styles were completely irrelevant and inappropriate.
