==== AGENT

PacSana

==== GOAL

Their goal was to create an emergency device that could be worn at all times without having to ever take it off.

==== DATA

Feedback from users on other emergency devices. Looked at currently existing emergency devices on the market.

==== METHODS

They created a wristband that has the trendy looks of a modern fitness tracker and is underpinned by a wealth of smart monitoring technology. Central to its “smartness” is movement monitoring which uses machine learning to build up a picture of the normal daily movement routine of a user. Once it has learned the pattern it can pick up changes in activity patterns that could signal something is wrong – for example, a user not rising at their usual time, wandering around the house in the middle of the night or being immobile in an unusual location in their home, such as a hallway. If an anomaly is detected the system sends an alert to a family member or care provider. PacSana has a button a user can press for help, but it also activates its own alerts if the person becomes incapacitated and is unable to raise the alarm.

==== RESULTS

“Our solution reviews movement data to enable proactive and efficient care outcomes based on real-time insights,” Duignan says. “These include preventative action, early intervention, post-event notification and calls for help. It also facilitates data-driven care packages that allow for optimal resource management in a sector that’s facing increasing demands for its services.

==== COMMENTS

I believe that this is a step in the right direction for a user to get the most out of their emergency device and to feel safe when wearing it. It will also comfort guardians with them knowing that their loved ones have a high grade emergency device that can notify them if anything ever happens.
