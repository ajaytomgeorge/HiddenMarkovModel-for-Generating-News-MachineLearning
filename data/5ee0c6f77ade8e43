== GOAL

Getting a quick and accurate reading of an X-ray or some other medical images.
Nowadays radiologists are in high demand to visually check the X-ray and give a reading,
they are trying to automate this process.

== DATA

Rather than working from entire images and radiology reports, they break the reports down to individual sentences and the portions of those images that the sentences pertain to. 
This estimates the severity of the disease more accurately than if you view the whole image and whole report. 
The model is examining smaller pieces of data, it can learn more readily and has more samples to train on.

== METHODS

The team is using deep leanring, neural networks and also utilizing a concept from information theory called mutual information.
A statistical measure of the interdependence of two different variables, in order to boost the effectiveness of their approach.

== RESULTS

The model could have very broad applicability. It could be used for any kind of imagery and associated text, inside or outside the medical realm.
The ideas have not been applied yet to a physical byproduct yet. Here is a link to the paper that was published on it, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04537.pdf.

== ISSUES

There are no issues I found from the news, seems to be a well established study and paper.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I thought the concept was interesting and the news article to be well rounded on information about.
A pilot program has started to see if their ML model can be used to help doctors make decisions in criticial moments,
which is interesting and I'll look into.
