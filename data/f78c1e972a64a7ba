== AGENT

Research

== GOAL

Simulating evolution of embodied intelligence in given enviornments

== DATA

multi-institutional dataset of intracranial 3D MRI scans from four publicly available sources

== METHODS

Deep Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning

== RESULTS

Detect brain tumors by looking at a single MRI scan of a patient. Had an accuracy of 93.35% on internal data, the model was 91.95% accurate on external data

== ISSUES
	
Overall dataset quite small only 2,105 scan split into 1,396 for training, 361 for internal testing and 348 for external. With a larger dataset could be more accurate and reliable, trustworthy
	
== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

Always great to see machine learning pushing in the healthcare industry, the body is a complex system and having another complex system which can notice the tiniest of details it is great to see.
