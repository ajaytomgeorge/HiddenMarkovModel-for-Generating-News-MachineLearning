==== GOAL

Generate text that would inspire humans to write horror texts. 

==== DATA

horror stories for "Shelley" and "scary" images for "Nightmare machine". 

==== METHODS

I haven't found exact type of network they were using, but i was written, that network 
working on combination of reinforcement and supervised learning. 
I've joined two projects into one because they one is based on another (stucture of it). 

==== RESULTS

You can check results on the links i've provided in source. 
Imagies and stories could be really uncomfortable and even scary to some people. 

==== COMMENTS

I love what hte guys did there. Teaching machine to scare human being - is what human being deseerve (to be 
scared). It can lead to a next level of horrors in moovies, games and literature. Example of implementation of such thing could be 
found in one of episades of "Black Mirror" called "Playtes". I'm realy looking forward to such things that could personalize your experience 
according to your own preferences and reaction in games or videos and that work, as for me - is one of the first steps.

And yes, i do know that this is rubish, especially as training set, but i can't just not mention things that exite me so much here, sorry.
