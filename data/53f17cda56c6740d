==== GOAL

The goal is to achieve mobile traffic forecasting.

==== DATA

In this work, a multi-source dataset released by Telecom Italia in 2015 is used. The dataset is one of the most comprehensive collections from an operator.
The input data is the A call detail record (CDR).


==== METHODS

Multitask Learning:In general, MTL learns several related tasks at the same time with the aim of sharing information between tasks.
The network is composed of multitask regression stage and feature extraction stage.

Recurrent Neural Network:To predict future network trafÔ¨Åc in a grid, historical data have to be properly considered.
The RNN model is suitable for sequence processing by using memory in cells.
Long short-term memory (LSTM) cells capable of learning long-term dependencies are adopted in the model.
LSTM based RNN has been demonstrated effectively on language translation and speech recognition.

Convolutional Neural Network: CNN is also considered to capture geographic-based features of mobile Internet usage.
Convolution operation over the grid map keeps spatial domain information among neighbor grids. 

==== RESULTS

The evaluated deep learning structures with Multi Task Learning enhance the prediction accuracy by applying CNN and RNN to capture spatial and temporal features effectively.
