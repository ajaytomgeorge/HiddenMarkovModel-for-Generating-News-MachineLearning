== GOAL

Accelerate Protein Engineering

== DATA

~50 deep mutational scanning and random mutagenesis datasets

== METHODS

Supervised

== RESULTS

In a benchmark study, the researchers showed ECNet outperforming current methods on several deep mutagenesis datasets. As a follow-up, ECNet was used to engineer TEM-1 β-lactamase—an enzyme that confers resistance to β-lactam antibiotics—and identify variants that had improved fitness and therefore, were more resistant to ampicillin.

== ISSUES

Seeing as this project is based on protein-modification, the project faces the standard ethical concerns related to genetic modification. 

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

The article lacks a lot of technical information, I had to find it in the published paper on the project.
I'll admit a lot of the big biology words went over my head but this project seems like a very good use of machine learning to accelerate the genetic engineering field
