==== AGENT

This project was developed at Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

==== GOAL

Their aim was to build a tool - "Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security (PAWS)" - that will predict poaching risk levels in different areas of a wildlife preserve.
Thus helping rangers to patrol against poachers more effectively.

==== DATA

The dataset used is gathered from another tool called "Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART)".
SMART records data on poaching activities that are logged by foot patrols.
The data includes the tracking of poachers' movements and the locations of traps they set.

==== METHODS

By applying machine learning methods to the aforementioned dataset, it can identify the areas that poachers are more likely to target, as well as suggest patrol routes.
The tool also uses algorithms to make predictions on poaching hot spots and divides the park into segments, classifying each of them as high, medium or low risk.
The machine learning models also consider factors such as distance to roads and towns, tree cover, topography, and animal counts.

==== RESULTS

Using the PAWS tool, a team in Uganda was able to identify a common poaching spot that rangers have never patrolled.
Another team in Malaysia used PAWS to provide evidence-based patrol routes for rangers. 
However, they discovered that they were unable to follow the route provided because there was a dense forest and riverbeds along it.
This meant that the tool still had to be improved, so that it can detect obstructions such as these and plan paths better.

==== COMMENTS

In my opinion, this tool is very relevant to current issues.
I agree that there are a lot of improvements to be made with the path planning, and I believe that machine learning techniques can also be used to do this.
