EPFLâ€™s Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory

==== GOAL

Create a prosthetic limb with better strength and precision control using automatic detection of grip methods.

==== DATA

Muscle signals collected from prosthesis users while trying to complete various motions and grips without the prosthetic. 

==== METHODS

Using the provided basic information, the prosthesis users would then attempt the same or similar tasks, this time using the arm. The arm would then monitor the area of contact, and maximise the covered area, adjusting grip strength to ensure it still follows the provided signals.

==== RESULTS

The method proved to be very promising in that it provides more user control and individual adjustment.

==== COMMENTS

A perfect example of machine learning being used to improve the quality of life for people, as oppsed to advertisements and personal gain.
