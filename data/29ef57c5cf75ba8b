==== AGENT

Samsung’s Moscow-based researchers

==== GOAL

Producee a system that can recreate lifelike motion from just a single frame of a person’s face

==== DATA

Images and paintings of faces. The more images/frams of a face the better the result but only one image/fram is needed.

==== METHODS

Uses facial landmarks to rotate a face with a single frame. Generative Adversarial Network, which essentially pits two models against one another, one trying to fool the other into thinking what it creates is “real.”

==== RESULTS

It's possible to take a picture of Einstein or Marilyn Monroe, or even the Mona Lisa, and make it move and speak like a real person

==== COMMENTS

Although most of the faces appear real and very well done, there are still some with definite giveaways that they are generated.
