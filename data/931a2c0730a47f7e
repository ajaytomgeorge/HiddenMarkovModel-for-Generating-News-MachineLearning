Yi “Edwin” Sun, researcher at the Beckman Institute Biophotonics Imaging Laboratory 

== GOAL

Enhance cancer image-based diagnostics by making them more accurate, faster and cost-effective.

== DATA

It uses historical data (images of cancerous cells) from the OCT machine to train their neural network.

== METHODS

The laboratory uses a supervised learning method which learns from historical data. With the image from the OCT system, the neural network uses segmentation and classification to analyze the image’s property.

== RESULTS

It matched with the OCT results with a deeper-level than the PS-OCT method.

== ISSUES

While a success was made, it is still in the development phase. More years of data is needed to go for clinical trials.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

It is interesting to see how deep learning can enhance diagnostics in the medical field with better precision while being cost efficient.
The article was correctly done which explained the main words to describe the topic as simply as possible. 
The approach of using deep learning in the medical field isn't new but it shows again the power of it with diagnostics.
It shows also that a lot more improvement can be done in many more fields if using deep learning methods.
