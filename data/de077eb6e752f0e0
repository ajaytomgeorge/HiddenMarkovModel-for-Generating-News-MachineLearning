==== GOAL

Train a system to learn the steering patterns of human drives as they navigate roads in a small area using only data from video feeds and a simple GPS-like map.

==== DATA

Collected data from local suburban streets using an automated Toyota Prius equipped with several cameras and a basic GPS system.

==== METHODS

They used a convolutional neural network that correlates steering wheel rotations to road curvatures it observes through cameras and an inputted map.

==== RESULTS

Seems to have comparable performance on small roads to more computationally intensive systems such as those using LIDAR but no concrete metrics are given.

==== COMMENTS

The lack of concrete metrics on performance is frustrating.
