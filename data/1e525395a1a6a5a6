== GOAL

Use machine learning to identify genes of importance in agriculture and medicine

== DATA

Research transcriptome and phenotype datasets, gene expression datasets

== METHODS

Gradient boosting, XGBoost, cross validation, regression

== RESULTS

Where able to reduce genetic noise, improving ability to identify genes relevant to crop traits.

== ISSUES

No issues with paper or press report

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

Interesting to see machine learning being used for agriculture again, using insight that can be found from this study might help continue increasing agriculture efficiency. The press report did a great job at condensing a very dense paper into an easy to understand article.
