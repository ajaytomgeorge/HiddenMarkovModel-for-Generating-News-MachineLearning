== AGENT

GitHub and OpenAI

== GOAL

To create blocks of code that do what is specified in English in a comment above the block

== DATA

The data was public code available on GitHub

== METHODS

Unsupervised learning. Powered by new AI System named Codex which is based on the GPT-3 model, the third generation of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer,
a model capable of generating sequences of text from single prompts.

== RESULTS

Program is able to produce blocks of code with surprisingly reasonable accuracy, but it's open to security issues such as SQL injection and other issues such as
declaring floats for conversion to string with too few bytes allocated.

== ISSUES

For the moment, the output code isn't very reliable and is therefore useless when considered for practical purposes.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I thought it was an interesting application of machine learning, but it should be kept as a for-fun
program rather than something that's used in actual programming for the forseeable future, as it introduces
way too much chaos to programming, something which should be precise and secure.
The reporting in the press was reasonable.
The method was new, but built upon an existing method.
