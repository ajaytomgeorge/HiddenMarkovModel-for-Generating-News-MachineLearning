== GOAL

Using Neural network identifies synergistic drug blends for treating viruses like SARS-CoV-2.

== DATA

Usually, large existing datasets are used for things like cancer and cardiovascular disease.
As COVID was a new illness they had to use different dataset.The model used jointly learns drug-target interaction and drug-drug synergy to mine new combinations.

== METHODS

The team is using deep leanring and neural networks. By modeling interactions between drugs and biological targets, we can significantly decrease the dependence on combination synergy data. 
The model isn’t limited to just one SARS-CoV-2 strain — it could also potentially be used for the increasingly contagious Delta variant or other variants.
In addition, the team applied their approach to HIV and pancreatic cancer.
They plan to use active learning to future enhance their research.

== RESULTS

The study has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
They can predict the synergy of two drugs.
Two new drug combinations were found using this approach: remdesivir (currently approved by the FDA to treat Covid-19) and reserpine. 

== ISSUES

There are no issues I found from this article, seems to be a well established study and paper.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I thought it was interesting what kind of application ML can have on cricitial and new world issues with COVID.
An issue with this type of study would be the evolving nature of COVID could bring new strains and the drug founded
in the study could in future become non-applicable.
