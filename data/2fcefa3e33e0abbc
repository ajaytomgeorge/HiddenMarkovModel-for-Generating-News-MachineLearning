== AGENT
Emily Henderson, News-Medical, reported by Nature Communications

== GOAL
ML algorithms and how they help in protein engineering

== DATA
Proteins and their components. 

== METHODS
Deep learning algorithm was used to look at the target protein and all its homologs to see their corresponding residues. They then combine this information and use the algorithm framework to figure out what kind mutations are important.

== RESULTS
The algorithm ended up outperforming current methods on several deep mutagenesis datasets.

== ISSUES
Very complicated article which isn't good for the average reader. 

== SCORE
4

== COMMENTS
As mentioned in the issues not a very good article in general for the average reader, overly complicated at that, didn't mention the exact methods of deep learning and the specific data and half the artilcle was quotes and Pharma jargon.
