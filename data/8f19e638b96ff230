Penn State

== GOAL

The goal of this experiment was to make archealogical findings about how Native
Americans in the southeast made shell-ring buildings.

== DATA

LiDAR images of 18 shell rings, 21 circular mounds, and 36 modern structures (to alleviate false positives).

== METHODS

A Convolutional Neural Network was used. 

== RESULTS

The netwok had validation accuracy of 75% for shell rings, 79.5% for shell mounds, and 59.5 for modern buildings.

== ISSUES

The dataset used to train the network was extremely small, which may have led to inaccuracies.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

The article was interesting and reported on accurately by the website.  I think the methodology 
was done well other than the fact that the dataset was small.  I was suprised that the network
worked so well under those constrains, but the use of a CNN was smart for LiDAR data.  This 
methodology was not new but has been very succesful for discovering new archeollogical findings.
