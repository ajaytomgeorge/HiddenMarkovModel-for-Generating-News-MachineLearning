==== AGENT

Reseachers From MIT

==== GOAL

Develop a system that measures patients pain level.

==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?
They got there data from particiapants during surgery while conscious who hooked up to this system on their forheads.
The data measured on a scale from 0-10 where 3/10 indicating a low level pain and 7/10 indicating a higher pain.

==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

Developed new machine learning techniques to make the system more accurate for clinincal use.They placed sensors on the patients head and different wavelength 
of IR light is shine into the skull. oxygenated and deoxygenated hamoglobin absorbs the signals differently. whehn the light reflected back they can detect the
level of hamoglobin levels present.When a patient is hurt there will be a sharp rise in the oxygenated hamoglobin levels and a decrease in deoxygenated hamoglobin level.


==== RESULTS

It was a success for this system. They had a personlized model and traditional model - (classifies if paient is in pain based on average resonse of entire population) this in evaluating if patients are in pain or not in pain.
When they took a random dataset of the pain scores the personalized model outperformed the traditional model reaching a reasonable 87% accuracy. 

==== COMMENTS

Your own personal comments and thoughts etc.
It is a good technique to measure the pain but it is requires lot of sensors to be placed on the patients head and this is usless during a surgery as the patient wont 
be conscious at all.
