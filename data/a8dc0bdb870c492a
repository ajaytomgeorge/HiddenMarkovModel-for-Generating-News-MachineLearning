Tracking down cyber criminals with the help of Internet IP addresses and with AI. The range of offenses are from sending spam and malware to stealing bitcoin. Even Amazon and Google has countless incidents from these cyber criminals.

The team trained their system to be able to identify 800 suspicious networks.

The hackers would exploit the Border Gateway Protocol, a routing algorithm that allows us to talk together online. The researchers would filter out all the IPs that were linked to hijackers and any malicious paths would had been found.

With 20% false positives, this is not as good as they wanted it but with minimal human supervision, this could be eventually deployed into their production environments.
