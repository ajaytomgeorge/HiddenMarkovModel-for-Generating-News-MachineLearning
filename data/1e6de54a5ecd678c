== AGENT

A SETI Institute data scientist named Jeff Smith and his team did this work, 
which is now part of a project by NASA which is called 'Asteroid Threat 
Assesment Project or ATAP for short

== GOAL

The goal of this project was to track and observe upcoming bolides heading 
towards planet earth, these are bright flashes of light caused by meteors 
and asteroids when they enter the earths atmosphere and explode

== DATA

It was said that Jeff and his team had built a bolide detection and light 
curve generation using the Geostationary Lighning Mapper which is used to 
record changes in the earths atmosphere. This bolide detection device has 
identified more than 2,600 boldies in the past 2 years. The GLM identifies optical
changes that show the presence of lighting, whitch detects millions of 
lighning strikes.

== METHODS

They used supervised machine learning  and accurate filters to 
create a new data pipeline to identify bolides.

== RESULTS

The first system they made had a very low detection precision of about 1.5% 
which meant that most of the detections made were not actually bolides.
After creating their second system the new data pipeline had a detection precision
of about 80%. This sytem has allowed more than 2,600 bolides to be detected in the 
past 2 years

== ISSUES

Some of the issues that could occur with this bolide detection machine learning system is accuracy,
although it said that the detection precision was 80%, there is still 20% unaccounted for. So the 
question I have is that is there a 20% chance that they could miss something heading for earth
that is a lot more serious than a bolide

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

Thought this was avery interesting piece, it really does a fantastic job explaining what
is happening and goes into detail about methods used to identify and observe these things.
This article gives us alot of information and figures of past and present methods of how the 
scientists intend to observe bolides which really keeps us keep up to date and helps us understand 
in basic terms what is happening around us.
