==== AGENT

Song Han, an assistant professor at MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and group of colleagues.

==== GOAL

To make a much more effecient models for training video recognition models. 

==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?

Youtube uploads nearly 30,000 hours of videos every hour. This can be anything from patterns, pixels in the video and
can build a model to train on these.

==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

Approximately training a video-recognition model can take up to 50 times more data and eight times more processing power than training an image-classification model. 
This ia a problem as the there is a high demand for processing power to train deep learning models continues to rise exponentially.They introduced more effiecient 
models where you were able to shrink the video recognition models to speed up runtime and performance. Their methods were able to shrink models to 1/6 by reducing the 
size of paramaters of 150 million to 25 million paramaters.Neural networks look for patterns in the pixels and build an increasingly abstract representation of what they see. 
With enough examples neural networks learn to recognize people,objects and how they relate.

==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?
They succceded in their quest.Top video recognition models use 3D convolutions to encode the passage of time in a sequence of images which creates more computationally-intensive models. 
To reduce this Han and his colleagues designed an operation they call a temporal shift module which shifts feature maps of a selected video frame to its neighboring frames.This outputed
a model which out performoed its peers at recognizing actions.But this model normally requires 2 days to train on a machine with 1 processor.
So han went to U.S. Department of Energy’s Summit supercomputer in which the model was trained in around 14 minutes.

==== COMMENTS

Your own personal comments and thoughts etc.

This was really intresting way of creating a  unique way of vidoe recognition models. It was a good factor to take into consideration the energy and run time required to train
a model Han developed by reducing the size of paramaters being pasased in.
