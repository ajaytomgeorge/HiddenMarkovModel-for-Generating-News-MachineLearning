== AGENT

Paige, a startup spun out of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)

== GOAL

Create an algorithm to predict prostate cancer

== DATA

Digital slide archive of New York's MSKCC

== METHODS

Supervised learning, categorizes a prostate bioopsy whole-slide image as either "suspicious" or "not suspicious" for prostatic adenocarcinoma

== RESULTS

Showed a sensitivity of 97.2% and positive predictive value of 97.9%, and a specificity of 99.3% and negative predictive value of 99.2% in identifying
core biopsies with cancer in a data set derived from an independent institution. Has also gained FDA approval for use in assisting doctors in making accurate diagnoses

== ISSUES

Probably not reliable enough to rely on solely, but since it's being used to assist doctors, that isn't really an issue.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

This was very interesting, because it's an example of machine learning being used to help with medical issues in a very modern or futuristic manner
The reporting in the press was mostly reasonable but they could have involved more information to do with the training of the Paige Prostate algorithm
