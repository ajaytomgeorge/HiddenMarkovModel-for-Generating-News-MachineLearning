== GOAL

What were they trying to accomplish?

== DATA

Machine Learning and Reader Input Help Us Recommend Articles

== METHODS

Natural Langugage Processing, Multi-Label Classification, Classification Algorithm

== RESULTS

The company has no control over which topics LDA Algorithm learns and the basis of number of topics

== ISSUES

In LDA, topics are learned based on the co-occurrence of words across the documents. We have no way of
guaranteeing that one of these topics corresponds to one of our established interests â€” or even that these topics are human-interpretable at all.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS


Your comments on this: It's is fasinating to get a recommendation reading just by mentioning my interest. We could have done 
it by K-means clustering as well according to my understanding
