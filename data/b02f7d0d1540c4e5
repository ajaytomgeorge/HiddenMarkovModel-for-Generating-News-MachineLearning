==== AGENT



Researchers from School of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Germany

==== GOAL

They developed a neural network to determine the subtypes of pancreatic cancer for 
better individualized treatment.

==== DATA



They used MRI scans from 55 pancreatic cancer patients, having a 70/30 train/test 
split.

==== METHODS


They trained a neural network on the MRI scans, distinguishing between two subtypes 
of pancreatic cancer.

==== RESULTS



The article reports that the neural network achieved high sensitivity and 
specificity and a follow-up of the patients the neural network has been tested on 
shows good survival rates.

==== COMMENTS



The article does not go into any technical detail of the neural network and the 
results are presented vaguely, i.e. no specific numbers are given. It presents the 
paper in a neutral way.
