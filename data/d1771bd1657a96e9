==== AGENT

Twitch software engineer Avery Gnolek

==== GOAL

Generate Surreal Emoji - This specific personal project was more to investigate the viability of the technology and produce some interesting images

==== DATA

The experiment hinged on a deep learning model called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), a system in which one neural network generates images until another neural network can no longer tell the difference between its output and the real images of the training data.

==== METHODS

Gnolek used a form of machine learning to create realistic-looking sets of the types of custom icons popular among Twitch users, including batches of fake human faces and cartoon avatars.

==== RESULTS

While the end result isnâ€™t going to replace the work of human designers anytime soon, the project is one of a growing number of ways that artists, agencies and brands are testing machine learning breakthroughs that have unlocked new creative potential for the technology.

==== COMMENTS

Great since it will save business time and money when creating logos, emojis for their sites to use.
