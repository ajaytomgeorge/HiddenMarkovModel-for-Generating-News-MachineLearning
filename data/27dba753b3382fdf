==== GOAL

To observe weather forecasting performance of different Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques to propose a weather forecasting model to forecast weather with high accuracy.

==== DATA

The 6-years historical weather dataset of rainfall and temperature of Chittagong metropolitan area were 
collected from Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD).

==== METHODS

Methods like Support Vector Regression(SVR) and ArtiÔ¨Åcial Neural Networks (ANN) for a robust weather prediction.

==== RESULTS

SVR can outperform the ANN in rainfall prediction and ANN can produce the better weather results than the SVR with acceptable deviation of error rate.

==== COMMENTS

Dataset from a single station of country were used but more data points is needed for better accuracy and more relaibility.
