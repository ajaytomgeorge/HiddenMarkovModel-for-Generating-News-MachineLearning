== GOAL

Developing a bio-compatible implantable AI platform that classifies in real time healthy 
and pathological patterns in biological signals such as heartbeats. 

== DATA

Data is a set of pathological signals like heartbeat of healthy and unhealthy people called as Diagnostic patient data

== METHODS

Recurrent networks

== RESULTS

It detects pathological changes even without medical supervision

== ISSUES

None

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

The method is very interesting, and the best part is that the model is general purpose based and can be used across many health monitoring data
However, the challenge would still be implanting an AI interface in humans
