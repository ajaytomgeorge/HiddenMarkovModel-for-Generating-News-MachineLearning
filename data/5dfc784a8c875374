== GOAL

Human-augmenting AI-based labeling system .Initially untrained deep learning models learn from human demonstration, train themselves, 
and begin to augment human annotation ability.

== DATA

Images from Cancer Genome Atlas were used.

== METHODS

deep learning model

== RESULTS
The workload reduction across the pathologists, when using HALS, ranges from 66% to 100%, as measured by their corrected fraction. 
The average workload reduction is 90.6%

== ISSUES
More data would be needed to train the model accurately.There are many cases where the pathologists will have different opinions 
and the result sometimes may be unprecedented . In such cases the model will incorrect result which cannot be relied upon.As this is concerning 
with human life it will be risky to fully rely on the model alone. The reliability of ML algorithms depends on the validity of the data 
on which they are trained


== SCORE
7


== COMMENTS
This can reduce human workload.Same repetitive tasks like cellular annotation usually done by pathologists can be 
done by the model.It can also increase the effectiveness of annoatated data. This is a highly beneficial tool in the medical field.
