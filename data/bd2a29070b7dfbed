==== GOAL

A new model that can help predict if patients are at risk for Alzheimer’s disease for the next 2 years.

==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?

The researchers leveraged the world’s largest Alzheimer’s disease clinical trial dataset called Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
The dataset contains data from around 1,700 participants with and without Alzheimer’s recorded during semiannual doctors visits over 10 years.
Data includes the AD Assessment Scale-cognition sub-scale (ADAS-Cog13) scores whch are the widely used cognitive metrics.

==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

They first trained a population model on an entire dataset that included clinically significant cognitive test scores and other biometric data
from Alzheimer’s patients. Also healthy patients collected between doctors visits. From the data the modle learns certain patterns that can help predict
how patient will score on the cognitive tests taken on doctors vists. For new patients a new personalized model updates score prediction based on new recorded data.


==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?

Experiments indicate accurate predictions can be made looking ahead 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Clinicians could thus use the model to help select at-risk participants for clinical trials 
who are likely to demonstrate rapid cognitive decline.In evaluating the model on new patients from a held-out portion of participants the researchers found the model's predictions werent
as accurate as they could be.So they personalized the population for new paient. After about 4 visits to doctor the personalized model significantly reduced the rate of error in prediction.
It also outperformed the traditional machine learning approaches used for clinical data.


==== COMMENTS

This was a really interesting study in the medical field. It clearly shows how important machine learnnig is and its neural networks.
