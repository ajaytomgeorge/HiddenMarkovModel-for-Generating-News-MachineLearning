==== GOAL

A Deep Architecture for Automatic NewsComment Generation

==== DATA

The first dataset is a Chinese dataset built from Tencent News, as well as an English language dataset from articles on Yahoo! News.

==== METHODS

DeepCom simultaneously employs two neural networks, reading network and a generating network.

All of the words in a news article are encoded as vectors for the AI to analyze. 
The reading network picks up what it calculates are the most important aspects of the article (a person, event, or topic),
before the generating network creates a comment based on that.

==== RESULTS

Experimental results on two public data sets indicate that the proposed model can significantly out perform baseline 
methods in terms of both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. The DeepCom neural network significantly increased engagement
with news stories on news websites by starting a dialogue and replying to human users.

==== COMMENTS

DeepCom on one hand increases engagement with websites which increases ad revenue for the news agency, however on the other hand it increases discorse
amongst users. Essentially this technology is just an advanced troll chat bot.
