== GOAL

Software that can reliably detect a premature baby's face in an incubator and remotely monitor its heart and breathing rates

== DATA

Infants were filmed with high-resolution cameras at close range and vital physiological data extracted using advanced signal 
processing techniques that can detect subtle colour changes from heartbeats and body movements not visible to the human eye

== METHODS
Neural network


== RESULTS
A computer vision system that can automatically detect a tiny baby's face in a hospital bed and remotely monitor its vital signs from a 
digital camera with the same accuracy as an electrocardiogram machine.Vital sign readings matched those of an electrocardiogram (ECG)
and in some cases appeared to outperform the conventional electrodes, endorsing the value of non-contact monitoring of pre-term babies
in intensive care.The study is part of an ongoing UniSA project to replace contact-based electrical sensors with non-contact video cameras, 
avoiding skin tearing and potential infections that adhesive pads can cause to babies' fragile skin.

== ISSUES
In the NICU setting it is very challenging to record clear videos of premature babies. There are many obstructions, 
and the lighting can also vary, so getting accurate results can be difficult

== SCORE
6


== COMMENTS
This is an interesting technique as it is contactless but the accuracy is questionable .
