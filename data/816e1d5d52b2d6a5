== AGENT

Who did this machine-learning-related work (e.g., Netflix)

== GOAL

autonomously fly quadrotors through unknown, complex environments

== DATA

simulated data of drones through unknown, complex environments

== METHODS

an algorithm that flew a computer-generated drone through a simulated environment full of complex obstacles

== RESULTS

the system was tested in the real world where it was able to fly in a variety of environments without collisions at speeds of up to 40 km/h

== ISSUES

does not mention if this can be done during the night

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

Drones are cool and this can be used for autonomous cars also
