== AGENT

Abyfarm, teaming with SPTel

== GOAL

To run a self-regulating farm at an optimal temperature with optimal water
and nutrient supply, and to control the qality and taste of fruit and veg.
Collectively produce about 1,600 tonnes of vegetables a year

== DATA

The farm uses sensors to collect and monitor thousands of data points,
including humidity and temperature. 
They also monitor the pH and electrical conductivity levels of the water.

What data did they use: what did it look like and how did they get it?

== METHODS

Each time a crop is affected by disease,
data about the occurrence and corrective action is fed into the system,
enabling its algorithms to formulate solutions for other farmers with similar crop issues.

== RESULTS

They were able to achieve this goal of 1,600 tonnes of vegetables a year with technology
that makes farming more effcient, scalable and less labour-intensive than before.

== ISSUES

The common struggle that companies like AbyFarm face with building an IoT solution
is that it is quite intensive in terms of ICT infrastructure.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I thought this article was interesting as it is something that I believe would be benificial to majority of large scale farmers who are tasked with overseeing 
a large plot of land and it could prevent crops for suffering on a large scale, Another interesting aspect of this paper I found was that it could advise farmers on
on the best time to transplant crops after germination and harvest for later sale. I think that the reporting of this article was quite reasonable and were able to highlight
some of the data collected in an interesting way.
