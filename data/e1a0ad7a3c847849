This model can be used to identify the learning styles using input students behaviors data. Two machines learning algorithms have been used: • K-modes algorithm: is used to cluster the learners’ sequences into FSLSM’s [The Felder and Silverman Learning style Model; J. E. Villaverde, D. Godoy, and A. Amandi, “Learning styles’ recognition in e-learning environments with feed-forward neural networks,” J.Comput. Assist. Learn., vol. 22, no. 3, pp. 197–206, 2006.]  learning styles combinations. • Naïve Bayes: is used to predict the learning style combination for a new sequence.==== RESULTSThe E-learning platform’s log file was pre-processed using web usage mining technique in order to extract the learners' sequences. Those sequences were mapped to learning styles combinations using the K-modes clustering algorithm and based on the FSLSM. The labeled sequences were used as training set to train the naive Bayes classifier and predict the learning style combination of a new student. To evaluate the performance of the used classifier we have used the confusion matrix method. The produced results show that our approach performs well. In the future work, we would like to have made a comparative study between the naive Bayes classifier and other machine learning techniques such as the Bayesian network and decision tree.==== COMMENTSThere are various e-learning platform that are already into adaptive learning methodology, if this method is not being used then there could be a difference in efficiency or accuracy seen in this model that could help in assessing if this method is a better fit for different requirements.
