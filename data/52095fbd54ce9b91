==== GOAL

They developed a neural network to identify suspicious networks that might be 
hijacking IP addresses.

==== DATA



They used data from network operator mailing lists and historical BGP (Border 
Gateway Protocol) data.


==== METHODS



They identified qualities of malicious actors from the data and trained a neural 
network to identify these automatically.

==== RESULTS



The neural network has a false positive rate of 20%, so that the researchers had 
to identify those manually.
