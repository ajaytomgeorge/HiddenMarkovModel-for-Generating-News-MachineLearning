== AGENT

Cleveland Clinic researchers with Owkin

== GOAL

Devlope and validate a deep learning model to predict survival and outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma patients after liver transplants

== DATA

293 whole-slide images and clinical data from HCC patients wh had a liver transplant

== METHODS

Deep learning model trained on histopathology data

== RESULTS

Findings show that the deep learning model predicted recurrence among transplant patients

== ISSUES

Fairly small sample of images all from the same clinic

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I think this was interesting, its good to see ML algorithms being used in the medical space to try to midicate the guess work and risk for patients and clinicians.
