==== AGENT

Netflix, Tony Jebara's Personalization Science & Analytical team.

==== GOAL

Netflix have used Neural networks to improve the user's personal suggestions 
when browsing through the application's content and to improve marketing.

==== DATA

Netflix has a professional Content & Marketing Science & Analytics team that 
consists of research engineers & Data Scientists. All Data is collected directly 
from the user's implementation and choice making.

==== METHODS

Netflix gathered many factors from the users command such as the content that they 
watched to the end, the content that they only partially watched, the content that they 
just previewed & even content that users searched for. They used this data to create a 
personal recommendations menu that may seem appealing to the users choice of content.

==== RESULTS

It became a massive marketing technique that improved the company's popularity as 
it helped to reduce the user's browsing time period and improved the user's satisfaction
with the services. This technique also helped the company's content research team to 
provide the right content at the right tie based off popularity of the content.

==== COMMENTS

I think this was a smart move for the company to get the edge over competing companies.
It may not be perfect but it is certainly effective and should be researched in more depth.
I feel that Netflix should invest more in research techniques that helps the customer's 
personal experience.
