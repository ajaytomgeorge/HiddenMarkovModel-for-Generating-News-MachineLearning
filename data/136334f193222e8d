== AGENT
  
Clearview

== GOAL

Identification of any american through images to aid police surveillance which includes new ways for police to find a person, including “deblur” and “mask removal” tools

== DATA

Images from social media

== METHODS

Facial recognition

== RESULTS

Documents from Clearview have claimed 98.6% or 100% accuracy while using their standard 99.6% confidence interval 

== ISSUES

The company is eroding personal privacy. Also, the “deblur” and “mask removal” tools can be highly biased and could lead to a person being wrongly identified

== SCORE
 
6. Although the technology is impressive, it is one of the use cases that has so many risks attached that I wouldn't endorse the use of such an application. Also, the way they are collecting the data is highly unethical

== COMMENTS

I don’t think the method is new. The innovation comes in the data collection which, again, I don’t think is ethical. They said they have scrapped over 10 billion photographs from the internet. I would say this would be one of the most complete data sets in terms of facial recognition besides those belonging to social media and Apple.
