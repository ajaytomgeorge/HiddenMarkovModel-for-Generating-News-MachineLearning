== AGENT

Fetch.ai

== GOAL

Create a machine learning AI that could create art to be sold as an NFT

== DATA

The data set was in the form of user-subbmited entropy (randomness patterns) which are essentially participant-generated squiggles. 

== METHODS

Once the dataset was generated, the next phase of the project involved voting from the paticpants in order to allow Fetch's algotrithm to deduce the preferential aesthetics amongst the creators. 
The machine learning algorithm then prodouced a series of orginal works.  

== RESULTS

The results came in the form of the first ever collective learning AI NFT collection. The results were spectacular, and have exceeded all expectations. 
The three winning NFTs were named "Smoggy", "Momentous" and "Dull". The most expensive (at the time of writing) is "Smoggy" which sold for 150 Ethereum (approx. $439,875.00)  

== ISSUES

No issues were reported.

== COMMENTS


I thought that this story was extremly interesting as it is a totally new approach to art. 
I also think that it would be really cool to see if an AI would be able to collaberate with an artist and create art in their style. 
There was not a lot of information on the algortihms used in this story.
