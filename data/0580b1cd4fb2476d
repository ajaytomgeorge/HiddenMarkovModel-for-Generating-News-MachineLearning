== GOAL

Predict Surgical Site Infections

== DATA

8883 patients from Mayo Clinic in America

== METHODS

Supervised learning and SSI-detection algorithms

== RESULTS

An alogirthm that predicts surgical site infections

== ISSUES

Currently there is no standard way the predictions are documented in the electronic health record portal

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

The algorithm works but is still not 100% accurate.
External validation of the model is required before it can be routinely used to identify SSIs.
If I was doing it I would've probable collected more data and implemented a way of properly saving and storing the predition.
