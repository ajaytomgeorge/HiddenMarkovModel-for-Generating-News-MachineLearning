==== GOAL

This paper focuses on using machine learning in the field of sports 
betting, using the National Basketball Association(NBA) as an example.
Their goal is to predict for every NBA game the total combine points
the two teams will score in a single game. They hope to come up with
an estimate that is more accurate that some betting platforms and use
this to place bets.

==== DATA

The data is classified into two groups, betting and game data.

Betting Data:
The betting odds data for all seasons dating back to (2007-2008) was found on 
https://www.sportsbookreviewsonline.com/scoresoddsarchives/nba/nbaoddsarchives.htm
This data consited of over-under, spread and moneyline indicators. However only the 
over-under data was used to evaluate the model. 

Game Data:
The game data for all seasons dating back to (2007-2008) was found on 
https://www.basketball-reference.com/
Data was collected for every game and included data points for points scored,
rebounds, assists and steals for both teams.

Using this data they built a featurized dataset, which included features 
such as points scored, points scored against, total rebounds, number of days 
since last game, distance travelled and offensive rating which were all 
calculated for the last three games.

==== METHODS

They used Random Forest, Singular Value Decomposition and Neural Nets.
The training set consisted of four seasons from 2012/2013 to 2015/2016 and used
the 2016/2017 season to validate the model.

==== RESULTS

The Neural Network has four-fully connected layers, reducing the input dimension from 1524, 
to 500, then 100, then 20, then 1 to predict the over/under of the desired game.
They evaluated the performance of the model through the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the 
predicted value and the true point total observed in the game. They found that the 
neural network correctly chooses over or under around 51.5% of the time.


==== COMMENTS

The featurized dataset only includes game level data and does not account for
the impact of player injuries or fatigue. If a key player on a team was injured,
this could have a huge effect on how many points a team would score.
