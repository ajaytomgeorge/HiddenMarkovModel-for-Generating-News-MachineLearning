==== AGENT

HealthCatalyst

==== GOAL

They are trying to help heath systems save lives by using machine learning. They are hoping to do this 
through catalyst.ai™, which is a model built into every Health Catalys application, healthcare.ai™, a
free open source software, and its healths care analytics platform.They plan on doing this by making 
machine learning routine, actionable, and pervasive in the health care industry.

==== DATA

Their own health Catalyst Data operating system. The data gets put into the system by doctors when meeting 
with patients. They take note of things such as height,gender, weight and age.

==== METHODS

Applied machine learning algorithms to their data set to try and find out who is more likely to catch a disease.
They do this by analysing the data collected from patients with that disease already diagnosed by doctors.

==== RESULTS

Still in development stage but it is very promising in spotting signs of cold/flu at the moment.

==== COMMENTS

I think this is a very interesting field of machine learning. It will have many possibly life saving applications in
the future. The fact that it is open source code means anyone with their own ideas can try to build on the existing algorithms
to help improve it.
