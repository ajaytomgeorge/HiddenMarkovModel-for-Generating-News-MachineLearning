== AGENT

A team of researchers at Washington University School of Medicine 
(Satrajit Chakrabarty , Aristeidis Sotiras, Mikhail Milchenko, Pamela LaMontagne, Michael Hileman and Daniel Marcus)

== GOAL

Their goal was to develop a deep learning model that is capable of classifying a brain tumor as one of six common types using a single 3D MRI scan.

== DATA

They used 2,105 scans into three subsets of data: 1,396 for training, 361 for internal testing and 348 for external testing.
To build their machine learning model, they developed a large, multi-institutional dataset of 
intracranial 3D MRI scans from four publicly available sources.

== METHODS

It was supervised : The first set of MRI scans was used to train the neural network to discriminate 
between healthy scans and scans with tumors, and to classify tumors by type. 

== RESULTS

Using the internal testing data, the model achieved an accuracy of 93.35% (337 of 361)
For the external testing dataset, the model had an accuracy of 91.95%. (320 of 348)

== ISSUES

It is quite accurate but there are some ethic problems i think : Can we trust the algorithms to the point we give them our health ? 
Is ~92.5% enough to do so ? Who will we blame when the machine will do diagnostic errors ?

== SCORE

I would say 8, this is just incredible to be able to give a diagnostic from an image and to achieve the work that need long years of studies for a human.
This example shows how machine learning can help us even for the most complicated tasks and how useful it can be.

== COMMENTS

It was quite interesting, I would not have seen these articles by myself.
This article explains well the topic but stays technical and gives useful numbers. 
I do not think the method is new. It was already used to detect brain tumors but not to classify it like this and with such good results.
The data and the methods were already used but not to get this output and this precision.
