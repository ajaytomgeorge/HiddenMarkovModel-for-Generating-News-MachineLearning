==== AGENT

University of California, Irvine

==== GOAL

Aim of the research was to use decision trees to classify forest fires into small, medium or large fires 
using two variables; firstly Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) a measure of the moisture in the air versus how 
much moisture the air can hold when saturated and secondly the fraction of spruce cover near where the fire 
first ignites.

==== DATA

The area of study was Alaska, with a study period chosen between 2001 and 2017.

Fire Data:

Data from ALFD (Alaska Large Fire Database) is a mixture of information from satellite and ground-based records 
giving details on fire points, perimeters, start dates and management options.

Data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) was used to cross-reference the ALFD database 
removing discrepancies when required. MODIS data was obtained from University of Maryland Geographical Sciences 
Department.

Meteorology:

Data from ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) was included. Data contained 2-m air 
temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, 10-m wind speed and surface air pressure.

Vegetation:

Data was incorporated from LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation Type product. This included two classes known to influence
fire behaviour; firstly black or white spruce forest cover (evergreen) and secondly birch or aspen forest cover
(deciduous)

==== METHODS

Various machine learning techniques were tried by the researchers such as random forest, k-nearest neighbours,
gradient boosting and multi-layer perceptrons. Random forest and decision trees were found to have similar level 
of performance while the other models tended to overfit the model, as such decision trees were used as the focus of
this research due do their ease of interpretability.

Diagram below illustrates a simplification of how class separation occurs in decision trees, here classes are
separated based on whether they meet the criteria of a conditional statement and separate depending on this
outcome;

        Condition 1
             |             
          Y  |  N             
       ______|______   Condition 2 
      |             | 
      |          Y  |  N
   Class 1    ______|______
             |             |
             |             |
          Class 1       Class 2

Classification and Regression Decision Tree Algorithm (CART) from the scikit-learn python library was used to 
classify the data into 3 groups; small, medium and large.

CART uses a measure known as Gini impurity which calculates how often a randomly chosen element in a set would 
be mislabelled if it were to be randomly labelled according to the distribution of labels in the subset.

The Gini impurity is calculated as;

$   I_g(P) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{J} (P_i)^2   $

Where I_g(P) is the Gini impurity, J is the number of class, i is an element of the set {1,2,....J} and P_i is a 
fraction of items labelled with class i in the set.


==== RESULTS

Results were predicted over a 1-5 day period after ignition.
With VDP alone the model was able to correctly classify small, medium and large fires with 46.1 +/- 6.7% Accuracy.

With both VDP and spruce fraction The researchers were able to correctly classify small, medium and large fires to 
50.4 +/- 5.2% accuracy. It was shown that fires with a low spruce fraction variable were less likely to develop 
into the largest size class. 

The model was able to predict that 40% of ignitions would lead to large fires that accounted for 75% of the total 
burn area.

Weather, early in the fires life can play a central role in determining whether the fire will be extinguished early or
grow large. It is suggested dry periods in the first few days of the 5 day period may allow the fires to persist through
wet periods but that further research is required.


==== COMMENTS

Given the recent forest fires in south America, this article is of particular interest in light of global warming
and the increase of forest fires occurring globally.

It also shows how large scale data from various sources can be incorporated into a model, for example the combination of
Meteorological, Vegetative and Fire data.
