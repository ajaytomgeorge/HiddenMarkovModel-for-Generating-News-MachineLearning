Very intreseting project with lots of room to gorw, nice seeing technology advance as most crop picking/back breaking jobs shoould never have to be done by humans. 
If I was working on the project I would've tested the robot with different types of fruit and veg. 
The reporting of the press was accurate and very easy to follow.
