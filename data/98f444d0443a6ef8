== AGENT

Singapore's Government Tech Agency

== GOAL

Their goal was to develop an Ai capable of phishing humans with emails.

== DATA

They used the deep learning language model GPT-3, along with other AI-as-a-service platforms.

== METHODS

I think the best way to do it is to do RL

== RESULTS

More people clicked the links in the AI-generated messages than the human-written onesâ€”by a significant margin!

== ISSUES

Will it be used in a way that everybody will benefit ? It might be used in an illegal way...

== SCORE

I would say 8, this is interesting to see how ML can allow us to create an algorithm capable of mimicking humans like this.

== COMMENTS

I hope this will allow in a certain way to detect phishing and maybe make the internet safer.
