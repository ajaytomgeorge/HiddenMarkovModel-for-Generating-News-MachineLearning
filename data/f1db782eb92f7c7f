== AGENT
Nathan Klein, Anna Karlin and Shayan Oveis Gharan
== GOAL
They were trying to create a better approximation for the solution to the
travelling salesman problem.
== DATA
To create the algorithm, Oveis Gharan, Saberi and Singh defined a random
process that picks a tree connecting all the cities so that the probability
that a given edge is in the tree equals that edge’s fraction in the best
fractional route. After this process spits out a specific tree, they plug
it into Christofides’ scheme for matching cities with odd numbers of edges,
to convert it to a round trip.
== METHODS
Their algorithm uses a random process to generate a tree in which cities
with an odd number of connections tend to have nearby partners. Then it
moved onto step 2 of Christofides’ method. Christofides’ method falls under
optimisation.
== RESULTS
While not optimal, the round trip produced by this altercation of
Christofides’ algorithms is better than the original.
== ISSUES
There’s no issue with the work but the results weren’t amazing. The
algorithm is only slightly better than Christofides’ algorithm.
== SCORE
7
== COMMENTS
The Travelling Salesman Problem is a very interesting problem in
optimisation ( one of the core underlying problems in machine learning)
however, I don’t know if we can call this altercation of Christofides’
algorithm a breakthrough. The results yielded minute improvements.
