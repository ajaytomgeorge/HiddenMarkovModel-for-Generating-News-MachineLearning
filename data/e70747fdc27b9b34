Digital Domain

== GOAL

Creating realistic digital humans

== DATA

Taking thousands of images of a persons face using different angles and lighting stages

== METHODS

Rendered in real time using NVIDIA RTX technology and Unreal Engine, neural networks
 
== RESULTS

Building the technology that allows artists to create the most photorealistic digital humans possible, and itâ€™s all happening in real time

== ISSUES

To recreate photo realistic humans digitaly still requires more computing power, better shaders and software

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

It was interesting as real time photo realistic human digital rendering is a new field, because such realistic rendering is only possible by CGI rendering frame by frame
