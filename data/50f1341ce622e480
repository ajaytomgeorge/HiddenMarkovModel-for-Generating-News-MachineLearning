== GOAL

The aim is to present a contactless and unobtrusive artificial intelligence (AI) framework that can detect and monitor 
MSA errors by analyzing the wireless signals in the patient’s home, without the need for physical contact. 

== DATA

A total of 107 healthy individuals (18–72 years of age) were recruited for this study. The individuals 
performed 1,203 positive examples of MSA events with insulin pens and inhaler devices at 40 different 
locations (offices, lounges, seminar rooms, kitchens, halls, etc).

== METHODS

The system works by transmitting low-power RF signals (1,000 times weaker than Wi-Fi) and receiving reflections from nearby people. 
Because up to 60% of the human body is water, it reflects the radio signals and modulates them with the person’s movements, capturing important information about the person’s MSA technique.

== RESULTS

This approach can automatically detect when patients use their inhalers (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.992) or insulin pens (AUC = 0.967), 
and assess whether patients follow the appropriate steps for using these devices (AUC = 0.952). The work shows the potential
of leveraging AI-based solutions to improve medication safety with minimal overhead for patients and health professionals.

== ISSUES

The reflections that are received from the system cannot be trusted to give the desired results everytime and thus chances of mishaps are more frequent in such an approach.

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

During these pandemic times, such an innovative approach will help the human society adapt better and cop with the situations more easier.
