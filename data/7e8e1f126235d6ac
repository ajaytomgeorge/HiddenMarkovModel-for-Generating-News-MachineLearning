==== GOAL

The goal of this experiment is to study the significance of Big Data and Predictive Analytics in Retail industries. This includes the opportunities in and possibilities arising from big data in retailing, particularly along five major data dimensions—data pertaining to customers, products, time, (geo-spatial) location and channel.

==== DATA

The data is acquired from retail industry and this data is combination of various things such as – 
First type arises from traditional sales data; second type of data source is demographics and purchase history of the customer, customer location, preferences, habit patterns and subconscious customer behaviour and finally how retailers optimize their physical store spaces for meeting sales, share or profit objectives.

==== METHODS

The field experiment is conducted in partnership with large national chain in US; By performing A/B testing approach, 42 stores are identified and divided randomly into test vs control. The main criterion for selecting the categories and the corresponding SKUs within each category was the existence of significant variation in their price history. 
In the next step, practitioners optimized prices over the aforementioned thirteen week out-of-sample period by maximizing total profitability across all categories and SKUs. The results show that there is a significant improvement in the gross margin dollar per SKU per week of 40.7 cents. 

==== RESULTS

The big data upgraded data quality rather than just climb in data volume. On the other hand, Predictive Analysis in retail wanders is set to rise in importance encouraged by additional breakthrough wellsprings of data joined nearby theoretical encounters using Bayesian examination.
