== GOAL

Fake News and Misinformation Detection using Supervised Machine Learning Model.


== DATA

The dataset is collected from various source like Kaggle Fake News Dataset 1,Kaggle Fake News Dataset 2,Victory University, Gofaas (511 news articles).


== METHODS

Supervised  Machine Learning, Naive Bayes, Support vector machine, Random forest, Gradient Boosting.

== RESULTS

Detecting whether the news articles are True or False.

== ISSUES

To label the fake news, detecting what category label belongs to, unable to find whether the dataset is pre-processed and also it is very slow process for discovering, processing and analysis.

== SCORE
