==== AGENT

Adobe

==== GOAL

To automate digital forensics and automatically spot edited pictures.

==== DATA

NIST Nimble 2016, CASIA, COVER and Columbia datasets however it does not say how many images were in these
datasets. 

==== METHODS

The system learned to spot common patterns that indicated tampering such as radom variations in colour and brightness, 
these are called digital artifacts.

==== RESULTS

According to the article " It scored higher in some tests than similar systems built by other teams, but not dramatically so" 

==== COMMENTS

The article is very click-bait-y as the headline reads "Adobe is using machine learning to make it easier to spot Photoshopped images"
but down the bottom of the article it says that the software can not be used for spotting deepfakes only images that have items removed,
copied or added.
