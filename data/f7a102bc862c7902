==== AGENT

Ross Quinlan C4.5 decision tree generating algorithm 

==== GOAL

Determine if there would be maritime fog based on rules and a decision tree

==== DATA

Weather ship observations originally used for testing and evaluating expert systems
Bouy measurements taken off the coast of California.
The data consisted of clear, haze and fog and other weather factors

==== METHODS

Create four rules for determining a clear, haze fog 

==== RESULTS

The program had an accuracy of 71% in predicting clear, haze and fog weather conditions 

==== COMMENTS

The rules generated by the machine was considerably less than the before used expert system.
The expert system had over 330 compared to the machine learning having less than 10.
The machine learning generated a greater accuracy in comparison to the persistence forecasting.
The rules generated were also much easier to follow compared to the common standard.
