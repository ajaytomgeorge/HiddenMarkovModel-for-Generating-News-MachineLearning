==== GOAL

Use GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to beautify portrait photos and keep post-processed photo realistic.

==== DATA

MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) consists a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. The database has a huge number of images of different faces and it also extracts features from a user face.

==== METHODS

Using TensorFlow to find facial features of a user once they have uploaded a photo, and then add new features to the image.
GANs comprised of two networks, pitting one against the other. One net attempts to generate realistic images, at meantime the other net provides a feedback that the generated images are flawed. Eventually, the generative network produces a realistic image (99.99999% realistic).

==== RESULTS

A user applies changes which can render their faces to look enhanced, and remain distinctive features which make users identify themselves.

==== COMMENTS

Owing to the resolution of an image, dataset is limited to 1080p. So, if you want to render any resolution above 1080p, the face in the image can be blurry.
