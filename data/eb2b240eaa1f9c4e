== AGENT

University of Pennsylvania

== GOAL

Help artificial intelligence (AI) move towards mimicking human behaviour and thought processes

== DATA

7 different datasets that included a total of 678 subjects and 9258 volumes:
A traumatic brain injury (TBI) dataset with lesions and white-matter hyperintensities
A developmental dataset
An autism dataset
A TBI dataset with lesions and white-matter hyperintensities
A dataset including cases with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and white-matter hyperintensities
A TBI dataset with lesions and white-matter hyperintensities
A dataset with only healthy control

== METHODS

3D-Densenet architecture, Supervised.

== RESULTS

94% accuracy in testing for detecting artifacts on diffusion MRI scans. Also the first method to be proven to detect artifacts in scans with pathologies.

== ISSUES

94% accuracy isn't good enough in a medical setting. The model is "agnostic" for a certain threshold of certainy, requiring a human to make a decision.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

The article doesn't mention the methods used in this project. Why do these biology papers never have an "ethics" section smh.
