==== GOAL

This paper is to study the correlation between crude palm oil(CPO) price, selected vegetable oil prices (such as soybean oil, 
coconut oil, and oliveoil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil), crude oil and the monthly exchange rate.

==== DATA

Monthly CPO prices, selected vegetable oil prices, crudeoil prices and monthly exchange rate data from January 1987 to February 2017 
were utilized.

==== METHODS

The Correlation between Crude Palm Oil and other oils were assessed by using criteria of root mean square error (RMSE), means 
absolute error (MAE), means absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Direction of accuracy (DA).

==== RESULTS

The prediction results exhibits that the support vector regression had higher predicted accuracy compared to multi-layer perceptron and 
Holt Winter exponential smoothing methods.

==== COMMENTS

The Attributes used which includes various vegetables oils and crude oil were enough to bring out the correlation and predition of CPO price 
but more attributes can be added utilised to come up with better CPO price forcasting.
