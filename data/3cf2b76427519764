==== AGENT

Yelp company 

==== GOAL

Developing a photo understanding system which allows us to create semantic data about individual photographs

==== DATA

Photos uploaded to Yelp.com 

==== METHODS

They took images from their hosting with labels, used " deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the form of ”AlexNet” to recognize those classes. 
Our CNN was built on AWS EC2 GPU instances based on the Caffe framework. To address Caffe’s software dependencies, 
we wrapped our CNN using Docker so that it could be more easily deployed." 
A convolutional neural network consists of an input and an output layer, as well as multiple hidden layers. 
The hidden layers of a CNN typically consist of a series of convolutional layers that convolve with a multiplication or other dot product. 
The activation function is commonly a RELU layer, and is subsequently followed by additional convolutions such as pooling layers, fully connected layers 
and normalization layers, referred to as hidden layers because their inputs and outputs are masked by the activation function and final convolution. 
The final convolution, in turn, often involves backpropagation in order to more accurately weight the end product.
Though the layers are colloquially referred to as convolutions, this is only by convention. Mathematically, it is technically a sliding dot product 
or cross-correlation. This has significance for the indices in the matrix, in that it affects how weight is determined at a specific index point

==== RESULTS

It helping company a lot

==== COMMENTS

Yelp did a nice job just boorowed already developed thing
