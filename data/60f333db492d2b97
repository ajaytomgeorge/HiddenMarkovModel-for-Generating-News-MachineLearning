== GOAL

Here we introduce a machine learning approach, which utilises a unique dataset of existing climate model 
simulations to learn relationships between short-term and long-term temperature responses to different climate forcing scenarios.

== DATA

study made use of existing simulations from a single global climate model. However, it opens the door for similar approaches to be 
taken with datasets from other individual climate models. 

== METHODS

We evaluate the performance of the two different machine learning methods (Ridge, GPR) by benchmarking 
them against a traditional pattern scaling approach often used for estimating future patterns of climate change. 
The latter relies on multiplying the long-term response pattern for the 2xCO2 scenario by the relative magnitude 
of global mean response for each individual climate forcer. 

== RESULTS

Challenges and opportunities for data-driven climate modelling, especially concerning the 
incorporation of even larger model datasets in the future

== ISSUES
Climate change around the globe occurs rapidly and these rapid shift should be dealth with quickly and this approach takes more time 
to deliver promising results which can be an issue considering the urgency in this case.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

Climate changes needs to dealth with and is going to have a huge impact in our lives in the future and such novel approaches can lead 
to reducing the effect to a certain rate.
