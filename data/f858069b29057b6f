==== AGENT

Engineers at Waymoworking with researchers at DeepMind

==== GOAL

find a more efficient process to train and fine-tune self-driving algorithms.

==== DATA

sensor data from vehichles of road lines, signs, other vehicles, and pedestrians etc.

==== METHODS

They used a technique called population-based training (PBT), this speeds up the selection of machine-learning algorithms and parameters for a particular task by having candidate code draw from the “fittest” specimens (the ones that perform a given task most efficiently) in an algorithmic population.

==== RESULTS

Improved efficiency and reliability of self driving cars

==== COMMENTS

very interesting how DeepMind first developed the PBT technique in 2017 as a way to speed the training of neural networks, later using it to help a computer to play StarCraft II
