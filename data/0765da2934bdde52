Providing feedback for programming related homework

== DATA

Not specified

== METHODS

Meta-learning

== RESULTS

Model was trained and able to give useful feedback to students on their programming problems on the course/website Code In Place.

== ISSUES
	
Meta-learning seems as a very good way to capture understanding on a general note. If though the tasks of students would become specialized per student, it wouldn't be as good at given useful feedback back.

== COMMENTS

Fantastic way of letting students know what their mistakes are and giving it to them in a way that they can learn and understand, it also eases teachers from tedious tasks and allows them to focus on improving other parts of the course / material
