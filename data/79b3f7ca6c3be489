== AGENT

Security researchers at the University of Plymouth and the University of Portsmouth, UK

== GOAL

Detect phishing sites based on markup visualisation

== DATA

Used binary visualisation libraries to transform the markup and code of web pages into images. Using this, they created a dataset of legitimate and phishing images of websites.

== METHODS

Supervised learning, target webpage's code is transformed through binary visualization and run through the trained model.

== RESULTS

Model has reached 94% accuracy in detecting phishing websites, and since it uses a very small neural network it can run on user devices and provide near-real-time results.

== ISSUES

I'm skeptical about the honesty in reporting the results, as they didn't go into a lot of detail in the article about how the results were verified.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

I thought this was interesting because phishing websites are all over the place, particularly if you use social media with a built in messaging system, or play
online games where the in-game currency has real-life value attached to it due to a black market.
The reporting in the press was reasonable, and this article was practically a summary of a research paper, including diagrams of how the system works.
