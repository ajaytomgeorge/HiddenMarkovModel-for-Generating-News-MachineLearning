ARTICLE 2  -  Deep generative models of radar
== SOURCE
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03854-z

== AGENT
Google's Sister Company Deep mind

== GOAL
Precipitation nowcasting, the high-resolution forecasting of precipitation up to two hours ahead

== DATA
Collection of radar composites from the Met Office RadarNet4 network

== METHODS
Supervised learning

== RESULTS
DGMR can predict rain within 1 or 2 hours

== ISSUES
The article I read was written by nature which collaborated with Deepmind to work on the article so some data might be falsified and made to seem better than it is

== SCORE
4

== COMMENTS
It is a nice idea and might be good when the public can get to use it to know the weather for short term situations
