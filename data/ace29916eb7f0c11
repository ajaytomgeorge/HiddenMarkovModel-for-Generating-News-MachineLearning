== AGENT

Programmer Gary Linscott, who is also a developer for the Stockfish chess engine

== GOAL

Creating a strong chess engine.

== DATA

Leela chess Zero starts with no intrinsic chess-specific knowledge other than the basic rules of the game. 

== METHODS

RL from repeated self-play

== RESULTS

Second to only Stockfish, the leading conventional chess program, in the most recent Top Chess Engine Championship.

None in particular. 

== SCORE

5

== COMMENTS

For an engine that was only released 3 years ago, Lc0 has come incredibly far by being consistently among the top 2 chess engines in the world. And with continued reinforcement learning, it would not be surpising if Lc0 was to overtake Stockfish in the near furture.
