To create user recommendations in order to increase user viewership / retention.
Create personalised thumbnails.

==== DATA

Data is gathered for each user. Data includes:
# of movies watched, # of minutes of each show watched
% of completion for every video/series
# of upvotes, which movies were favorited, etc
% of overall watch content that is attributable any specific show (and therefore level of affinity that user has to a specific show or related cast members)
any seasonal or weekly trends related to a userâ€™s level of engagement, etc.

==== METHODS

Unsupervised learning to create recommender system. Model is trained using user's watch history is order to gauge user's interest.
Users with similar interests are grouped.
Netlix creates meta-data for individual frames in the show, using lighting, # faces, symmetry etc.
These images are classified, eg. horror, romance.
Based on model trained on user's profile, suitable thumnails are created for different users.

==== RESULTS

Netflix's dynamically created thumnails are shown to increase user interest.

==== COMMENTS

Netflix recommenders are generally quite effective, though from experience most people end up endlessly scrolling anyway.
