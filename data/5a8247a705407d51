==== AGENT

Netflix personalisation by Netflix

==== GOAL

Make the user experience better by recommending movies or tv show that the user has previously watched, changing the cover of movies and tv series to better suit your taste.

==== DATA

Netflix gets their data based on what you have previously watched or clicked on. It also suggests things to watch based on other userâ€™s profiles watch history that are similar to yours.

==== METHODS

Netflix use the method that if previous users watched one thing and then went on to the next then its like that if you have just finished watching the same thing then you will probably want to watch what they did afterwards too. The cover image of their content changes depending on what Netflix thinks what will make you click onto them based off of the previous things you clicked into.

==== RESULTS

Netflix learned a lot from this data as in they learnt not to show too many people and what characters to show to the viewers. It also means that Netflix knows what content and cover image the user wants to see to keep them watching. This means that Netflix will keep a higher user rate. 

==== COMMENTS

In my opinion this worked very well due to the fact that if you cater to your viewer and suggest similar content to what you just finished you are more like to keep watching.  If you change what the content covers look like then you have a higher chance of getting people to click on the content.
