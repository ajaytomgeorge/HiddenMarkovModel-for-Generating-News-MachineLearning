== GOAL

Use machine learning to increase to speed for stop motion animation

== DATA

No real mention of data, most likely they used images of hand and trained the network to recognise hands

== METHODS

Used a hand pose detection model from a Jetson Xavier NX to recognise when the hand is out of frame them takes
the picture

== RESULTS

They were able to cut down on the time taken to make a stop motion animation. By not having to manually 
take the picture they could focus on moving the characters in the sceen.

== ISSUES

To achive this it would still take a long time, you would also need the right equipment which could be expensive

== SCORE 

8

== COMMENTS

I found this very interesting and it showed how people are usingf ML for more hobby based projects and other tasks that
ML can be used for. The report didn't mention much about the algorithm but does have a link to the github page of
the creator. This method seemed rather new for stop motion and would definitly save on time
