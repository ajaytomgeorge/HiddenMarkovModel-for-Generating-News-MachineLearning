== AGENT

Karjan Institute.

== GOAL

Complete Beethoven’s Tenth Symphony.

== DATA

They used Beethoven’s completed works, what’s known about his methods to compose music, and his sketches of the symphony.

== METHODS

I believe they used supervised learning algorithms.

== RESULTS

The algorithm was able to complete the Tenth Symphony in such a way that only experts intensely familiar with Beethoven’s sketches for the work were able to tell where the original stopped and the AI began.

== ISSUES

Some may see a problem with attempting to complete a famous artist’s incomplete work.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

I think it’s very cool that they were able to finish a piece of music so complex with a machine, and that it was so accurately done that the majority of people wouldn’t know that it was computer generated.
