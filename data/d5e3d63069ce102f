==== GOAL

Teach network to add colors into the black and white image

==== DATA

They was using b\w wersoin of image as input and network
was comparing after processing proposed version with collored versoin. 

==== METHODS

Approach is based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks [Krizhevsky et al. 2012] that have been proven able to learn
complex mappings from large amounts of training data. Ntwork is formed by several subcomponents that form a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) and contain important discrepancies with widely-used standard models:
	1. can process images of any resolution
	2. incorporates global image priors for local predictions
	3. can directly transfer the style of an image into the colorization of another

==== RESULTS

Result is impressing. Network managed to almost completely restore colors of
images and this was achieved by using "local" and "glodal" details. 

==== COMMENTS

a HUGE potential to work with old hotos and videos
