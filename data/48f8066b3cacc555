Doctoral student in Bioinformatics, University of Illinois at Chicago

== GOAL
develop a technique that allows biomedical researchers to figure out the functions of the proteins that turn genes on and off in cells, called transcription factors. This knowledge could make it easier to develop drugs for a wide range of diseases.

== DATA

Biological data of patients 

== METHODS

Bayesian Inference

== RESULTS

Bayesian inference transcription factor activity model (BITFAM) is based on a fundamental biological principle that the differences in scRNA-seq profiles of individual cells reflect distinct underlying transcription factor activity states

== ISSUES

NIL

== SCORE 

9

== COMMENTS

This project will help biomedical researchers to develop drugs for various kinds of diseases
