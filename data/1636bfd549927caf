==== GOAL

They developed a neural network to detect brain tumors using a blood test.

==== DATA



They collected their own data using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy on blood samples, thus being able to get a biochemical 
"fingerprint" of brain cancer.

==== METHODS


They used the "fingerprint" they detected from the data to train the neural network.

==== RESULTS



The article reports that the neural network has a sensitivity of 83.3% and a 
specificity of 87%.

==== COMMENTS



The article presents the results of the paper as a possible cost effective way to 
help diagnose brain tumors in the future. It does not go into technical detail.
