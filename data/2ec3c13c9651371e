Molecule.pne

==== GOAL

The goal was to create a tool that would simplify the process of turning a simulated molecule into one existing in real 
life.

==== DATA

The ML modle used millions of patents and known chemical processes, the data fed in was text.

==== METHODS

There was no algorithm given, however it did say that the model was trained on the data set mentioned above. It had 
access to millions of processes during it's training.

==== RESULTS

The goal was accomplished. It has been used and is currently making breakthroughs. It has been used to create molecules 
that haven't been seen by any chemist.

==== COMMENTS

This is a great breakthrough for the world of chemistry, the article was well written however they did not provide any 
information on the algorithm used.
