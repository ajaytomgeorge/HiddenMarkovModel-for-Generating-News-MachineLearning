University of Glasgow

== GOAL

Accurately predict which animal viruses that can go on to infect humans 

== DATA

Viruses in animals 

== METHODS

It interprets information encoded in the viral genome

== RESULTS

Being able to predict which viruses can cause a threat to humans and rank the threat from low medium high and very high

== ISSUES

If a new virus is detected in animals, it might be to late to if the virus has already transferred over
== SCORE

7


== COMMENTS

Without any prior knowledge of the previous SARS outbreak in humans, this model was able to accurately predict that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the Covid-19 pandemic, and its closest viral relatives found in animals, had a high risk of being able to infect humans. This finding, together with more formal testing on hundreds of viruses with known zoonotic status demonstrated that the model could make accurate predictions on viruses that are entirely new to science.Â
