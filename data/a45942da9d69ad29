==== GOAL

The paper looks to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using maching 
learning techniques due to the rapid increase in online based transactional sales.

==== DATA

The dataset consisted of 1000 records with data points for credit card usage, 
current balance, holder of a credit card, holder status, credit card age, 
holder's property, housing, job, location.

==== METHODS

First they pre-processed the data described in the data section above. Then
they split the data into 70% training set and 30% test set to train the data. 
They then used the AdaBoost algorithm on the training set to build the model, 
finally the model was tested for accuracy on the test set.

==== RESULTS

They used several machine learning techniques but conclude that AdaBoost algorithm
preforms better in fraud detection giving them an accuracy of 100% on predicting 
fraudulent credit card transactions. 

==== COMMENTS

This dataset may not represent a real life scenario as fraudsters are constantly
increasing their strategies Adding a variety of emails for both ham 
and phished the system would be closer to a real life scenario.
