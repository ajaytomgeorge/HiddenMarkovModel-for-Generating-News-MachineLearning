==== AGENT

Jim Gao, Data centre engineer at Google.

==== GOAL

Gao's goal was to use machine learning to take in large amounts of data from Google's 
already tracked sources and analyse this data to predict power usage
effectiveness and use their power more effectively. Simply finding methods to save time,
energy and money from the data centres.

==== DATA

Gao built a neural network framework that would take in data that Google had already been 
tracking such as energy levels being used at a particular server and temperature both inside
and outside.

==== METHODS

After taking in the data tracked by Google, Gao's model would then analyse the operating 
configurations and interdependencies that are too dificult for the human mind to analyse.
this analysis is then used to predict future power usage effectiveness within a range of
+/- 1 standard deviation.

==== RESULTS

Gao's model was tested and approved by Google DCs. According to Gao's LinkedIn account,
This project led to energy saving in Google's data centres and a revenue increase in 
Google's wind farms.

==== COMMENTS

This project seems like a method that should be implemented into all companies and 
industries with data centres that use large amounts of power. It is an idea that could 
benefit both financially and environmentially. Jim Gao saw the importance of machine 
learning in today's society and really put this to use at Google.
