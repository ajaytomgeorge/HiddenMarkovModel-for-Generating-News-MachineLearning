== GOAL
 
Accelerating the diagnosis of genetic syndromes in children.

== DATA

The team tried to identify the disease patterns that are not immediately obvious to the human eye or intuition, and to help physicians non-specialized in genetics

== METHODS
The Deep learning technology was trained with data from 2,800 pediatric patients from 28 countries. Additionally, the technology also considers variables related to sex, age, racial, and ethnic backgrounds.
== RESULTS

The technology can look at facial photos rather than the need of specialized clinics.

== ISSUES

N/a

== SCORE

9
== COMMENTS

This technology is great as millions of babies every year are born with a genetic disorder especially in places that lack the right medical equipment so this could become such a valuable asset to the medical community.
