== AGENT
Michail Alifierakis, PhD candidate at Princeton University

== GOAL
To make a model that evaluates whether a restaurant is likely to succees or fail within the next four years.

== DATA
Yelp’s business rating prediction dataset

== METHODS
Linear logistic regression model

== RESULTS
The results from the model are promising and it defines whether a restaurant will remain open or not. It has been seen that if the restaurant is a part of chain then it closes less frequently.

== ISSUES
The health inspection data was not present and information about the surrounding venues.

== SCORE
8

==COMMENTS
It is very interesting that using ML is not limited to any particular field. It is a good improvement in the food industry to predict the performance and take the necessary measures. This will help in feedbacks to improve service to users as well as restaurants’ owners.
