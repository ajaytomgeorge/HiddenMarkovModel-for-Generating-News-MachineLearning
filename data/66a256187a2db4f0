high school student Jade Greenberg and  Jacci Cenci a solutions architect at NVIDIA

==== GOAL

New beehive to monitor for varroa mite infestation.
==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?

Greenberg’s team captured images in the California beehive every 10 seconds and then used NVIDIA’s machine learning to detect the presence of varroa mites on bees.
They were individual frames from vidoes of beehives.

==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

Initial method was to take 300 bees, put them in a jar, sprinkle powdered sugar on them, shake the jar, and count how many mites fall off of the bees.
But instead they took pictures of beehive every 10 sec and used NVIDA'S machine learning to detect for the presence of mites.
They used individual frames from videos of healthy beehive and from different beehive where the mites are present. Fed into a model to train a computer algorithm.

==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?
It is still under prototype stage. As she decides to add features to measure physical properties such as ventilation and heat distribution.She was a finalist
at Intel International Science and Engineering Fair so her idea for saving beehives from mites is well recognized.

==== COMMENTS
This is a smart idea for the future as it is still under research. Beekeepers job is minimized as the machine learning takes over the observation of the mites present in
the beehive. We can see that AI and machine learning is the future of our society as it is very powerful and takes minimal effort.
