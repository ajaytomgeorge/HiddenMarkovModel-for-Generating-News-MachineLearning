==Agent
CCDC - Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre

==Goal
Train machine learning (ML) models to predict stable polymorphs to use in new drug candidates.

==Data
scientists all over the world have contributed published, 
experimental crystal structures to the CSD, which now has over 1.1 million structures.

==Methods
Knowledge based predictive model, Supervised learning.

==Results
Researchers use crystal structure databases to make knowledge-based predictions about whether a potential new drug is comprised of a good, 
stable form that manufacturers can make, store, and deliver in a therapeutic manner.

==Comments
It's an interesting new way of using existing data and methods.
