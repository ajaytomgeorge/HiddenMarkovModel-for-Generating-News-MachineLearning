== GOAL

An application that uses artificial intelligence to detect and track usersâ€™ coughs, a hallmark of many respiratory conditions including COVID-19. 

== DATA

Data collected by installing an app in smart phone.

== METHODS

Supervised learning model.

== RESULTS
With the help of AI-assisted cough tracking,team envisions a world in which users who have been coughing at a higher rate than normal for, say, 
two weeks would receive a text notifying them of their symptoms with directions to a public clinic that can test them for tuberculosis.

== ISSUES
Cough could be due to many reasons need not be a pandemic always.The app also raises question about privacy of recording audio eventhough the 
scientists claim only audio of cough will be recorded.

== SCORE
6


== COMMENTS
The application sounds interesting especially in this era where people tend to ignore minor symptoms and only approach hospitals when it gets worse.
. But it could have been better if multiple human actions could be tracked on a single application.
