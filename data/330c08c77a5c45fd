== GOAL

Predict neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in a high-throughput manner

== DATA

1933 virus-antibody sequences and their clinical patient neutralization response

== METHODS

XGBoost, Random Forest, Multilayered Perceptron, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression

== RESULTS

 ML models were trained on 14 different virus types and achieved over 90% fivefold test accuracy.
The out of class prediction is 100% for SARS and 84.61% for Influenza

== ISSUES

There entire research is revolving around sequences of viral coat protein-antibody pairs. 
There could be other unknown factors too

== SCORE

6

== COMMENTS

Relevant at this time of pandemic. Though there wasn't anything which was breakthrough in the study.
