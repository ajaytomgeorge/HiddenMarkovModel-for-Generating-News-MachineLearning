==== AGENT

Google Maps

==== GOAL

Predict Real-Time Bus arrivals

==== DATA

The data is collected from gathering bus locations from public transportation agencies and those connected to google maps out on the road.

==== METHODS

They analyse real time data from those on roads currently. They look at the speeds users are travelling at, cross referencing
that with other factors such as location, time of day, distance traveled etc.

==== RESULTS

The results are far more reliable than standard bus timetables. Google have even released a feature to tell how crowded the bus may be
