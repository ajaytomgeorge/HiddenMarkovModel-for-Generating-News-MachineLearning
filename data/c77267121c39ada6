==== AGENT



Researchers at University of Oxford, UK

==== GOAL

They developed a facial recognition neural network to recognize chimpanzees in the 
wild, allowing them to track them over several generations.

==== DATA



They used more than 10 million images of animals.

==== METHODS


They trained a facial recognition model (presumably pre-trained) on the data. The 
model distinguished between individual chimpanzees and predicts their sex.

==== RESULTS



The neural network has an accuracy of 92% for identifying chimpanzees and an 
accuracy of 96% for identifying their sex. The predictions are done within a few 
seconds. The researchers compared this to humans, whose accuracy in identifying 
chimpanzees was about 42% and who needed about 55 minutes for their predictions.

==== COMMENTS



The article does not go into any technical detail of the neural network. It 
describes that facial recognition technology is used more and more to track 
animals such as pigs and cows.
