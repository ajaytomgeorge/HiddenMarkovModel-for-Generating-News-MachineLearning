==== AGENT

Spotifys big data and machine learning panel.

==== GOAL

What were they trying to do?

Spotify are using machine learning to tailor music and create personalized playlists that they 
think a user would enjoy the most.

==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?

Spotify got their data from observing patterns in behaviour of its original users.
From a user playing one song, Spotify obtains 4 pieces of information about that user: metadata, 
interactions generated, who users are, and playlists
 
==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

Spotify’s machine learning has two main functions. The first is its deep 
learning network that’s made up of learning nodes that learn from each  
user, whether they skip or stay on a particular song and how frequently they play 
particular songs. The second is a convolutional neural network, which is made up of cover art, 
layering songs on songs through matrixes to find similarities in lyrics, tones, frequencies,
volume, and what mood it conveys. This network refines its knowledge based on the trial and error from 
the deep learning network.


==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?

This is a very successful method of personalizing a users spotify suggestions for them which is proven 
by the fact that spotify is the world leader in providing music and has 100,000,000 monthly subscribers.
Spotify creates a daily mix playlist for a user based around music they have been listening to recently.

Your own personal comments and thoughts etc.

Using machine learning is key for Spotify as it enhances a users experience and helps them to discover
