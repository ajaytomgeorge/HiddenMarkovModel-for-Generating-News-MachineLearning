==== AGENT

Facebook, Google, Amazon....

==== GOAL

1.Simulate a customer service representative in an interactive way.
2.Resolve simple requires in an effective way.
3.Create self-service solutions.

==== DATA

Interactions between customers and support staffs from customers chats, emails, messaging apps. 

==== METHODS

M.L is used on dataset of human-to-human conversation.  
1.Reshape data into single rows of observations and add to the classifier (message-response), then set some restrictions, remove URLs, image, etc.
2.Add grammar into the M.L, tokenizing, stemming, and lemmatizing of the chats by using NTLK.
3.Generate word vectors (such as LOL, LMAO), train a model in this phase by using TensorFlow. 
4.Deploy TensorFlow model on the server.
 
The steps below show how chatbot works:
a. It analyzes the user requests to identify what user wants and to extract relevant entities (messages).
b. Chatbot provides the most appropriate response upon user requires.

==== RESULTS

Able to simulate conversations with customers in their corresponding native language through apps, webs or emails.

==== COMMENTS

It is still not able to solve complex problems. Therefore, it is mostly used for auto-reply, checking list, booking/canceling appointments, etc.
The chatbots are still not able to pass the Turing test.
