==== GOAL

The goal is to use a machine learning classifier to identify serial hijackers before they can launch
an attack, and pro-actively prevent these attacks. 

==== DATA

The data provided is essentially a random subset of available information about a user, which is then
analysed by the extra-trees. Information would include how regularly the user was online, IP etc.
Outliers in these fields would then be flagged.

==== METHODS

They use a machine learning technique called an extremely-randomized trees or extra-trees
classifier. Extra-trees classifiers are essentially a growing forest of trees, where each tree
represents a vote of confidence, so a forest would represent a group consensus. If most trees
have concluded that someone is a serial hijacker then you can safely determine that the user is
a hijacker.

==== RESULTS

In a test with this classifier, the system flagged 934 autonomous users out of 19,103 to be potentiel 
serial hijackers. This is still under development but results so far results have been relativly
consistant.

==== COMMENTS

Through machine learning techniques such as extra-trees, serial hijackers will struggle to operate. 
There are a few issues with this method of detection that will see ordinary users flagged as hijackers.
