==== AGENT

A team affiliated with Facebooks AI research

==== GOAL

To offer users style tips to improve their outfits.

==== DATA

Thousands of publically available images were source from chictopia a fashion social 
media site. The team took images of the most up to date fashion trends in order to teach
their system style. By altering the oufit via photoshopping in a different top or 
pants the team were able to educated the computer as to what was good taste and what
was a poor fashion choice.  

==== METHODS

The team gave the system two sets of images, one set contained bad style the other set 
contained 'on-trend' outfits and fashion statements. From this the system was able to 
learn the difference between good and bad taste and could then be used to suggest outfits 
or how to finish off outfits that were already partially constructed for it.

==== RESULTS

The program is still in the developmental stages but is capable of assembling outfits 
based on colour and style although it is not yet able to interperet texture.
the teamalso seek to adapt it to determine suitability of an outfit to particular needs
for example it would be in bad taste to wear a tracksuit to a funeralbut at the same time 
you wouldn't wear a suit to a football match.

==== COMMENTS

Although the application may seem trivial and maybe even silly to some people i believe 
this technology has some very interesting core concepts and could be adapted to other 
applications in the field of image processing.
