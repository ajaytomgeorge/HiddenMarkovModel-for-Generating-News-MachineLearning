AGENT: 
		 AzureML Team 

GOAL:
		To predict whether scheduled passenger flight is delayed or not using a Binary-classifier.

DATA:
		Passenger flight on-time performance data taken from TranStats data collection from U.S. Department of Transportation.
			The dataset contains flight delay data for the period April-October 2013.
		Hourly land-based weather observations from NOAA.
			The weather data represents observations from airport weather stations, covering the same time period of April-October 2013. 
			Before uploading to Azure ML Studio, they processed the data as follows:

METHODS: 
		After some preprocessing of flight data and weather data.
		
		Using Azure ML Studio. 
		Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree module was used and trained it using the training dataset. To determine the optimal parameters, 
		they connected the output port of Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree to the Sweep Parameters module.
		
		For comparison, they created a model using the Two-Class Logistic Regression module, and optimized it in the same manner.
		The result of the experiment is a trained classification model that can be used to score new samples to make predictions. 
		They used the validation set to generate scores from the trained models, 
		 and then used the Evaluate Model module to analyze and compare the quality of the models.
		
		
		Add the Score Model module to the experiment canvas
		Finally, to test the quality of the results, add the Evaluate Model module to the experiment canvas.
		
RESULTS:
		The boosted decision tree model has AUC of 0.697 on the validation set, which is slightly better than the logistic regression model, with AUC of 0.675. 

COMMENTS:
Azure ML Studio is a strong tool for maching learning
