==== AGENT

Researchers at MIT and UCSD

==== GOAL

To help identify exploits of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), a standar routing protocol.

==== DATA

The team got their data from several years worth of network opertator mailing lists, as well as historical BGP data 
taken every 5 minutes from the global routing table.

==== METHODS

They used the data to train a ML model that would help identify suspicious networks

==== RESULTS

Using the results they have pinpointed roughly 800 suspicious networks.

==== COMMENTS

There was no info about the type of algorithm used or how the results wil be put to use.
