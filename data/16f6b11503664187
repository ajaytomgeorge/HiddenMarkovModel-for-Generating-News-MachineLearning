== AGENT

Researchers at UC Davis

== GOAL

Their goal was to detect wildlife health issues in real time (Neurological disease for example)

== DATA

The researchers used five years of data and more than 200,000 records to establish baselines for how frequently these conditions normally occur. 

== METHODS

Supervised

== RESULTS

It creates alerts and is works pretty well but the article does not gives numbers

== ISSUES

Maybe some alerts are not real and need to ne checked ? 


== SCORE

I would say 5, this is really useful but it is just an alert and does not answer really the problem.

== COMMENTS

This article explains well the topic but is not really technical and does not gives useful numbers.
