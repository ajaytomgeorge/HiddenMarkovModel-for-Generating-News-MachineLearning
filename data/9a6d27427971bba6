==== GOAL

Use Machine learning algorithms to distinguish good and bad stocks.

==== DATA

Historical Data of various stocks are used to backtest and come up with the list of good stocks.

==== METHODS

Algorithms ranging from traditional statistical learning methods to recently popular deep learning method, 
e.g. Logistic Regression(LR), Random Forest (RF), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and the Stacking, 
are trained to solve the classiÔ¨Åcation task.

==== RESULTS

Each model they come up with using LR, RF, DNN and stacking outperforms the market.

==== COMMENTS

They have used relatively small set of stocks to choose from and used 244 Techinal and Fundamental factors to 
come up with stock selection, but a more stocks and factors are needed to give a reality check.
