== AGENT

The Japan Science and Technology Agency

== GOAL

Use machine learning assess finger movement during the 10-second grip and release test in order to determine whether subjects have cervical myelopathy.

== DATA

Time series data of finger movement taken from patients, 50 of which have cervical myelopathy while 28 do not.

== METHODS

Supervised learning

== RESULTS

They developed a highly accurate cervical myelopathy screening tool which is more accurate at diagnosis that by a specialist using physical findings

== ISSUES

None

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

I found this story very interesting as it demonstrates the power of machine learning and that they are in fact better than humans at certains tasks provided
that the task required is reasonably narrow.
