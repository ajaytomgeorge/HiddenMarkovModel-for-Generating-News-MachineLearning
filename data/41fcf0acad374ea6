==== AGENTS
Tom Weber, assistant professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Rochester. 

==== GOAL
To determine how much methane gas is emitted from the ocean, into the atmosphere, each year.

==== DATA
All available methane data from the ocean. 

==== METHODS
All the available data was fed into a machine learning algorithm. (Algo type not specified). 

==== RESULTS
The algo was able to recognize patterns in the methane data and predict what the emissions might be for regions with no
observations.

==== COMMENTS
No specific details about what the data looked like or what type of machine learning algorithms where used.
No mention of what the features of the data were.
