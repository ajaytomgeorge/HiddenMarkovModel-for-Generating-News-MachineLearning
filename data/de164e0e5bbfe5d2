== COMMENTS

The reporting in the press wasn't focuessed on the Machine Learning aspects of the project, it was more about what it could achieve.
The majority of the article was quoting the CEO about Windward, his agenda seemed to be getting more companies to provide data.
Thus I would not consider him a reliable source of information on how the data will be used.
