Dionisio== GOALTo detect and recognise the plant variety and the type of diseases the plant was infected.== DATA35,000 images of healthy plant leaves and infected with the diseases.== METHODSConvolutional Neural Network== RESULTS32 different plant varieties and plant diseases dataset were used.ÊThe trained model was 96.5% accurate in detecting and recognising the infected plants.== ISSUESAccuracy of the model could be improved by increasing the dataset and training the model without any interpretations.== SCORE6== COMMENTSThis type of models helps farmers around the world to early recognising and detecting the infected plants and take necessary measures required.
