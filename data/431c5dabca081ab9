== AGENT

Lehigh University

== GOAL

Their goal is to identify structural similarities and trends in material

== DATA

They used set of 25,133 piezoresponse force microscopy images to train their machine.

== METHODS

I think it was RL since they created the algorithm to do another thing and then trained it on the set

== RESULTS

They were able to group similar classes of material together and observe trends, forming a basis by which to start to understand structure-property relationships.

== ISSUES

?

== SCORE

6 can be really useful.

== COMMENTS

The article is technical and gives number, it is a really interesting way to use ML.
