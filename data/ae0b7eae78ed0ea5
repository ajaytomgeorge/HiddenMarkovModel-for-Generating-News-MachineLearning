== GOAL

The researchers were trying to improve manuverability for quadraped
robotics by simulating a large group of them on rough terrain and 
using a NN to improve how they move. 

== DATA

They simulated 4,000 quadraped robots.

== METHODS

The robots were trained on a reinforcement model.

== RESULTS

The team was successful in improving the mobility of the real world
robots.

== ISSUES

No issues with experimentation

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

The article was very interesting and both the methodology of the 
experiment and reporting by WIRED was good.  Reinforcement learning
is not new but the team used it in a simulation so they could
run the experiment simultaniously over many instances concurrently.
