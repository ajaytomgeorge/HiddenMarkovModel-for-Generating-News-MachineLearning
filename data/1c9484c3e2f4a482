== GOAL

Combine Text and Images in the Google Search

== DATA

Using the data from the google searches and the appropriate images related to it

== METHODS

Multitask Unified Model of Google

== RESULTS

They have managed to create an algorithm which is capable of searching the web based on the images or the object pointed by one's camera.

== ISSUES

The condition of the object might be a problem in returning the results as the algorithm matches every pixel in the images.

== SCORE

8

== COMMENTS

It is an interesting idea. Given how accurate the results are it is a great feat to achieve. I might have added more datasets from different regions of the world as the same product or thing might have some variations in other countries and have different names as well.
