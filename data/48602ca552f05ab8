====GOAL 

Detect IP hijacking before it occurs. 

====DATA 

Volatile changes in activity 

Multiple address block 

IP addresses in multiple countries

The machine learning system tagged networks with three key traits as shown above in terms of the blocks of IP addresses they us 

====RESULTS 

IP address hijacking will no longer be an issue 

====COMMENTS 

Internet security is a massive issue and machine learning could pose as an answer to a lot of online security problems.
