==== GOAL

Predict ocean methane emissions

==== DATA

Methane data from monitoring the ocean 

==== METHODS

The data was fed to the system to create emmissions models using pattern recogition

==== RESULTS

They have been able to predict methane emmissions even in regions without prior data

==== COMMENTS

The ariticle is not descriptive on what kind of data the gathered methane data from the oceans is specifically or how the data was used to train the system
