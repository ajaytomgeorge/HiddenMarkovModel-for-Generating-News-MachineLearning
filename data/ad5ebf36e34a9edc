==== GOAL

To deterimne a persons cardiovascular death risk based on their ECG signal.

==== DATA

ECG data was taken from patients who had previously experienced acute coronary syndrome. 
The different ECG data was catagorised into risk quartiles depending on the severity of 
their cardiac condition and the likelyhood of recurring episodes.

==== METHODS

The program was trained to recognise a healthy electrocardiogram versus and unhelthy one
using this information by reading just the first 15 minutes of a persons 
electrocardiogram the system could catagorise their risk.

==== RESULTS

This system showed a lot of promise in the fact that assessed ECG readings and placed 
the patients into catagories very finilar to how an actual doctor judged the risk of 
the patient. The obvious application is in thefield of medicine however it could help 
assess patients more efficiently and at a greater scale which would cut the cost of such 
an assessment making it cheaper and therefore more accesssable to the general public. 

==== COMMENTS

In my opinion this technology will have a fairly insignificant overall effect however 
its underlying components could be applied to many other graph analysis problems such 
as analysis of tectonic activity.
