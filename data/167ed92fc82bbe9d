== AGENT
Bastani et al.
== GOAL
To create a model that can predict people who are most likely to be carrying Covid-19 at the Greek border and airports to increase the 
efficiency of testing.
== DATA
Passenger data such as where they're from, their age and gender.
== METHODS
Reinforcement Learning (RL).
== RESULTS
The machine learning model doubled the efficiency of Covid-19 testing at Greek borders and airports.
== ISSUES
The main issue I can see with the model is the data. The data was limited to align with the EU's GDPR rules, which reduced the models potential 
performance ability.
== SCORE
8
== COMMENTS
The issue with the data being fed into the model is an interesting topic in my opinion. While it is important to comply with the EU's GDPR 
legislation, should exceptions be made in order to protect the citizens of a country in such unforeseeable conditions? As the data necessary 
for the model's optimal performance is blocked by legislation, this puts more lives at risk.
