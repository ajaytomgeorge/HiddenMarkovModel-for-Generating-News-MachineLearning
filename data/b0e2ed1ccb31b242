== GOAL
A Novel Stacking Approach for Accurate Detection of Fake News

== DATA
ISOT fake news dataset and KDnugget dataset. ISOT dataset was entirely collected from real-world sources


== METHODS
Evaluating the performance of five machine learning models and three deep learning models on two fake and real news datasets of different size with hold out cross validation.

== RESULTS
At first they removed the stopwords and urls from our dataset. Then, we used tokenization methods like TF, TF-IDF and embedding to obtain the text representation. After that, we trained individual models including five machine learning models such as LR, DT, KNN, RF and SVM and three deep learning models like LSTM,GRU, CNN on these text representation features.

== ISSUES
However, these proposed methods have some limitations in terms of accuracy.

== SCORE
6

== COMMENTS
They have evaluated five machine learning models and three deep learning models on two fake news datasets of different size in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
