==== AGENT

Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine at Stanford University

==== GOAL

To create accurate predictions of cancer type / progression.

==== DATA

Data included images of 2,186 lung tissue slides, disease classification, and patient suvival times.
Through feature engineering, nearly 10,000 features were extracted from the images eg. cell shape, size etc.

==== METHODS

The method used was a type of supervised learning. The algorithm is called Random Forest, which is a type of regression.
The model used the images and -Omes (eg. genomes, proteomes) as inputs, and outputed the survival rate.

==== RESULTS

This algorithm was more than 75 percent accurate in distinguishing between healthy tissue and the two cancer types,
and it could predict who fell into the high or low survival group with greater accuracy than models based solely on the cancerâ€™s stage.

==== COMMENTS

This is a good way of finding a new use for already existing data, by using supervised learning.
It's simple but effective.
