== GOAL

predict the structure of the 20.000 proteins and position in the human body

== DATA

instructions contained in our genomes - the DNA contained in the nuclei of the human cell 

== METHODS

Unsupervised

== RESULTS

It predicted predicted the structure of 350.000 proteins of humans and other living organisms. Also predicted the structural position for 58% of the amino acids in the human proteome and could predict the position of 35.7% with a very high level of confidence

== ISSUES

None

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

It is a AI use in the medical space and most of the AI stuff in medizine is quit impressive. Especially with the genomes as data set it impressed me a lot. It reported only the upside for the pharmaceutical industry but didn't look at the potential harm you could do with such a knowledge.
