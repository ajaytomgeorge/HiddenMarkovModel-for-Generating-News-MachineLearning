== AGENT

Cellino

== GOAL

To use machine learning to idnetify high and low quality cells

== DATA

They have a dataset about different properties of cells like shape, size and desnity of a cell

== METHODS

Supervised

== RESULTS

The algorithm indentifes low quality cells and removes them

== ISSUES

What issues do you see with the work (if any)? Technical problem,
ethical issues, honesty in reporting the results, etc.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

This article was very interesting to me. It didn't go into lots of detail of the biology and I understood the overall idea of what was going on, If the article went to deep into the biology end of things I would have been lost.
