for-some-reason

==== AGENT

Beihang University and Microsoft China

==== GOAL

In short, create the best comment bot in the world.

==== DATA

The aricle didn't explicitly say, but reading the actusal papers published they fed in text data.

==== METHODS

The system is made up of two neural networks: a reading network that "comprehends" an article and picks out important 
points, and a generation network that writes a comment based on those points and the title of the article.

==== RESULTS

The bot was a success. It had several examples shown of articles they had the bot read and the comments that it left.
It is almost impossible to tell that it's a bot and not a human

==== COMMENTS

The article was one of the best written I've seen as of late, however I do think that this project is a terrible idea.
Bots of this calibre were already used during the past election cycle. If this is used by the wrong people it will just
make things a lot worse.
