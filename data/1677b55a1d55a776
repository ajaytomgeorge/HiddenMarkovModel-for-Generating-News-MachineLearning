==== AGENT

The agents working on this project are Ian Hutchins and his colleagues in the Office of Portfolio Analysys team,
who is also lead by George Santangelo at the National Institutes of Health.

==== GOAL

The goal that Ian Hutchins and his team was to research and use AI and big data predictions to
see which is the best way to influence future medical treatments.
Research was done to find an AI / ML learning model to predict which scientific advances and discoveries
would most likely be used by clinics and in turn influence medical treaments and research.

==== DATA

The team have used data over the past 2 years of their research in this field. They use publically available data, 
such as articles written in this field along with thier own research that is done in this Institutes such as the National 
Institutes of Health. They also make thier data publically available. Any citations related to this field are also used as 
data for this research.

==== METHODS

Hutchins and his team have in the past 2 years quantified many predictions using Approximate Potential to Translate (APT).
These values were used by the team to focus attention on areas of science that have a high rate of translational potential.
This compliments researches research on medical treatments to better influence and evaluate the best strategy for a 
given medical treatment using data-driven decision-making.
This model computes APT values and makes its predictions based on content of research articles.
Using public citation data as well, the model measures scientic influence at the article level, looks at the time of 
publication, if the research has already been adopted, etc to influence its predictions also. Called Relative Citation 
Ratios (RCRs).

==== RESULTS

This is still ongoing and the results gained so far is will be used in conjunction with later research done
to better improve these learning models and in turn allow for more confident results for medical treatments
and advancements.

==== COMMENTS

I think that this is a very interesting field of research that could be used to help the advancement of different
medical treatments and strategies. This information could be used to help treat many diseases and find the most 
appropriate treaments for non-curable diseases, etc.
With this also comes an decrease in death-rates and an increase in life expectancies which can be viewed as both a 
good thing and a bad one, with over-population being an increasing issue now.
As also stated in the article, many of these types of models are restricted in the fact that they are normally proprietary 
models and it is good that the team doing this research has decided to make their data publically available.
