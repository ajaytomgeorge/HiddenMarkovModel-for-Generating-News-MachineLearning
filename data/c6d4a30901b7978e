==Agent
Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

==Goal
Using machine learning to process the data and revisiting the canonical view of a cell.

==Data
Janelia scientist, also released data portal, OpenOrganelle, where you can access the data sets and tools they have created.

==Methods
Saalfeld and Heinrich's segmentation algorithm and COSEM(Cell Organelle Segmentation in Electron Microscopy) algorithm, 
Supervised Learning.

==Results
Resolving power of the FIB-SEM imaging was amazing, and they were able to see things at a level they couldn't have imagined, 
that how different organelles and structures are arranged relative to each other â€“ how they're touching and contacting each other, 
how much space they occupy.

==Comments
It was interesting new way of using existing data and methods, with that data they built algorithms that incorporate prior 
knowledge about organelles' characteristics.
