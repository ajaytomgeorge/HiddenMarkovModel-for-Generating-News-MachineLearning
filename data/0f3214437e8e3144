== COMMENTS

The article was interesting, explaining the first three games of the tournament. However, it didn't cover the last two games and AlphaGo weakness during the forth game.
A lot is explained about people's reaction but not about the two players that faced each other
The event was unique and it was to show the power of nowaday AI. It used a neural network as a way to beat Go players which was never used before. As successful as it is, it shows that this new method has a big potential for the future of the AI field.
