==== AGENT
Turnitin

==== DATA
As part of the study, 24 experienced markers used Turnitin’s Authorship Investigate tool
to evaluate 20 student assignments, which included 14 genuine assignments and six that
were purchased from cheating sites.

==== GOAL
TurnitIn's goal is to try and improve their system of detecting assingments that have been cheated on using machine
learning.

==== METHODS
The AI and ML systems were able to analyse sentence complexity, sentence length, and other stylometrics,
as well as document information such as date created and last modified and used these information points to train a
neural network to be able to predict bettwe whether or not a uploaded piece of work was done through cheating or not.

==== RESULTS
While Turnitin’s AI and ML detections weren’t perfect (it detected 59% of all cheating cases),
it’s a step in the right direction for more intelligent cheating detections.
Without AI and ML, markers were only able to detect 48% of cheating instances.

==== COMMENTS
I think this is an interesting use of AI as it affects me directly as a student that uses the Turnitin service.
The story is short and concise and outlines all the main points making it easy to understand the goal of Turnitin.
