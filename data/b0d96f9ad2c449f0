==== GOAL

To simultaneously simulate dozens of patient characteristics, in order to work towards personalized medicine for Alzheimer’s Disease.

==== DATA

The data was comprised of 18-month trajectories of 44 clinical variables from 1909 patients who had Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer’s Disease.
These variables included the individual components cognitive exams, laboratory tests, and background information.
The variables were classified as binary, ordinal, categorical, or continuous.

==== METHODS

They created an unsupervised machine learning model called a Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM) to simulate detailed patient trajectories.
Using this model they were able to create synthetic patient data.
This model was created using a neural network capable of learning and sampling from the joint probability distribution of covariates across multiple times.

==== RESULTS

This work is still on-going, and is slowed by the limited availability of high quality longitudinal health datasets and the limited ability of current machine learning methods to produce insights from these datasets.
However the work has been shown as a proof on concept, where the synthetic patient data accurately reflect the means, standard deviations, and correlations of each variable over time, 
to the extent that synthetic data cannot be distinguished from actual data by a logistic regression.

==== COMMENTS

This work makes great progress into understanding Alzheimer’s Disease.
Since the disease acts differently within different people, and patients often react differently to therapies, a personalised medicine would highly beneficial.
