== GOAL

To develop a more efficient algorithm of reservoir computing.

== DATA

The data inputted was in the form of phase space data of dynamic (sometimes chaotic) systems. The inputs could be described as how each coordinate evolved over time.

== METHODS

Reservoir computing is a recurrent neural network. The method called NG-RC uses dynamic calibrations to ignore noise and to avoid over fitting.  

== RESULTS

Their new model performs between 33 and 10e6 times better than the current model. It is especially efficient when analysing chaotic systems with a high accuracy. The algorithm is far more efficient as there isn't the need for thousands of parameters, only around 30 to be superior to the current algorithm.

== ISSUES

There are no majorly obvious issues with the method, however there is still not a mathematical formalism, it is only known how they work.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

The article was an interesting read, to hear of such a massive advancement in machine learning is awesome. The ability for more accessible hardware to tackle complex problems will eliminate the trade-offs of efficiency vs accuracy. The report in the press did a good job of summarising the results, but not detail of the theory, likely due to its advanced nature.
