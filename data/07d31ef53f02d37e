== GOAL

Find the quality of life for people with ALS.

== DATA

Information that was able to be provided from consenting caregivers and patients, to explore what factors could be likely to affect their quality of life.

== METHODS

Reinforced learning, data pooling.

== RESULTS

The timing of when the disease symptoms started and whether they have issues with breathing when lying down – that could reduce their quality of life. Also for primary caregivers, how they view their role and purpose seemed to be linked to their quality of life.

== ISSUES

The data set can be distressing to source as some of the people with ALS can    be saddened by their condition also what causes people to have a poorer quality of life can be quite variable and hard to predict.
== SCORE
8
== COMMENTS

Its a very powerful story as it shows how the application of machine learning can make the world a better place. It caused me to see machine learning as a new way to make the world a better place for everyone.
