==== AGENT



Samply- product by Justin Swaney, a Ph.D. student in the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering





==== GOAL



The tool that could help music directors in making music



==== DATA



The data set is used from the sample library uploaded by the user. It is set of the audio collection containing the wide range of audio samples 




==== METHODS



It analyzes audio waveforms using a convolutional neural network.It uses relatively little pre-processing compared to other image classification algorithms. This means that the network learns the filters that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. This independence from prior knowledge and human effort in feature design is a major advantage.







==== RESULTS

Samples were classified based on their sonic characteristics and the result is a classification of similar sounds which are closer together and different sounds are father apart. It also allows multiple sample libraries to be processed at a time thereby shortening the lag.








==== COMMENTS

Samply is a great application which shows the changes machine learning can bring in the Music industry
