==== GOAL
Harness the power of machine learning to design dielectric (non-metal) metamaterials that 
absorb and emit specific frequencies of terahertz radiation.
==== DATA
Adjusting the height, radius and spacing of each of the four cylinders changes the frequencies of 
light the metamaterial interacts with.
Calculating these interactions for an identical set of cylinders is a straightforward process that 
can be done by commercial software. But working out the inverse problem of which geometries will 
produce a desired set of properties is a much more difficult proposition.
Because each cylinder creates an electromagnetic field that extends beyond its physical boundaries, 
they interact with one another in an unpredictable, nonlinear way.
==== METHODS
The network takes 24 inputs—the height, radius and radius-to-height ratio of each cylinder—assigns 
random weights and biases throughout its calculations, and spits out a prediction of what the 
metamaterial's frequency response spectrum will look like. To maximize the accuracy of the machine 
learning algorithm, the researchers trained it with 18,000 individual simulations of the 
metamaterial's geometry. While this may sound like a large number, it actually represents just 
0.0022 percent of all the possible configurations. After training, the neural network can produce 
highly accurate predictions in just a fraction of a second.
==== RESULTS
The researchers then tested their new system to make sure it worked. They hand drew several 
frequency response graphs and asked the algorithm to pick the metamaterial setup that would 
best produce each one. They then ran the answers produced through the commercial simulation 
software to see if they matched up well. They did.
