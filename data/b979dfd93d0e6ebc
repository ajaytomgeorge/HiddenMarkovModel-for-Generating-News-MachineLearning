==== Goal 

Using AI to give better predictions on the prognosis in cancer patients  

==== Data 

Data came in the shape of images (or pathology slides) and -omes of various sorts  

==== Methods  

Applying ever-more sophisticated machine learning approaches to these datasets can yield accurate diagnoses and prognoses, and even infer how tumors evolve 

==== Results 

Now, scientists are finding that images can predict -omics. Combining the two data sources gives researchers even better predictions of how long a cancer patient will live. The goal of these algorithms, currently under development in basic biology labs, is to help doctors select treatments and forecast survival. 

==== Comments 

I’m happy that AI is being used to help doctors figure out what the best course of action is when it comes to treating cancer. This may help the doctors in deciding what type of treatment would best suit a patient. An earlier prognosis may be key to saving a patient's life, so I’m excited for more improvements to be made in the future as all the things I mentioned above should be better also.
