A Photographer named Jonas Bendiksen.

== GOAL

He used the images(data) of his twitter followers and used them to create a life like human pose in his photos.

== METHODS

He used the profile pictures of his followers in twitter and used them by modifying it, i.e, Reinforcement Learning.

== RESULTS

Bendiksen  had created the people in the images with software and his work was so flawless that o one noticed until he purposefully admitted or provoked the social media to find the error in the methods.

== ISSUES

Privacy issue as one can't use others pictures without their knowledge. Also creating a fake profile to trigger his own exposure is kind of a bad thing to do. 

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

It was new to me. Creating a 3D subject for the photo which we take using the normal profile pictures is a crazy idea and at the same time need precision and a concept to make it look uneditable. Everything went smooth and no one would have noticed if he had kept his mouth shut about it.
