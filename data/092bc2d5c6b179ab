== AGENT

University of California, Berkeley

== GOAL

The team of researchers is trying to use machine learning techniques to
understand the microscopic structure of materials.

== DATA

The team used a collection of 25,000 'symmetry aware' images to train the 
network taken from Zenodo.org which was then applied to an unstructured 
dataset of microscopic images of material structures. 

== METHODS

The team used a Convolutional Neural Network.

== RESULTS

The team was able to predict symmetry with >99% accuracy

== ISSUES

No issues

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

This article was very interesting because it could lead to larger
dscoveries related to material symmetry at the quantum level.  The press
reported accurately on this article and the methodology itself was good.
They employed an interesting new way of using existing methodologies and
data to find new correlations.
