==== AGENT

Sebastian Schuchmann

==== GOAL

For the police car and the jeep to learn how to reach their individual goals

==== DATA

Sebastian created a simulated environment and programmed the vehicles with goals in mind.
The jeep had to reach the finish line before time ran out, the cop car had to stop the 
jeep from doing so. With this information he simulated the chase over and over again. 
each time the cars both began using more advanced evasion and cornering techniques.

==== METHODS

Sebastian used reenforcement learning. The cop car was rewarded every time the jeep 
failed to reach the goal and punished whenever the jeep reached the finish line. The 
opposite was true for the jeep if it reached a finish line in time it got rewarded 
otherwise it was punished. This created a competitive development between the two 
vehicles forcing them to adapt to gain the upper hand

==== RESULTS

The result was a marked improvement in evasive action taken by the jeep and the same 
could be said of the cop car with respect to its blocking ability. Overall the results 
were close to what Sebastian set out to achieve however they were far from perfect.

==== COMMENTS

This program in itself is unsubstancial and all in all underwhelming. Having said this 
the underlying genetic algorithm can be adapted to numerous other problems such as self-
driving cars, mars rover autopiot software, and many other adaptive systems.
