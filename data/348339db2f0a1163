== AGENT
Ruth Williams, Journalist, the-scientist.com 

== GOAL
To understand exactly which stimuli activate which brain cells

== DATA 
Computer generated images.

== METHODS
Deep Learning & Neural Networks

== RESULTS
About 70 percent of the time, by following this procedure the neural responses can be stretched higher than what had been seen in response to natural images.

== ISSUES
The testig of the functional similarity is limited.

== SCORE
7

==COMMENTS
It’s creative that we’re not only mimicking the brain and how it works not only in humans but also in other animals as well.
