Machine Learning in Finance: The Case of Deep Learning for Option Pricing

https://srdas.github.io/Papers/BlackScholesNN.pdf

==== AGENT

Robert Culkin & Sanjiv R. Das from
Santa Clara University

==== GOAL

Machine learning is being used to learn option pricing models from the markets, 
and could be trained to mimic option pricing traders who specialize in a single stock or index.

==== DATA

Historical Trading Data was used for the option pricing model.

==== METHODS

They Trained a fully-connected feed-forward deep learning neural network to reproduce the Black and Scholes
(1973) option pricing formula to a high degree of accuracy.

==== RESULTS

Their experiments show that simple deep learning nets can be used to learn price options with very low error.

==== COMMENTS

As per this paper only the technical data is digested by the ML to come up with a pricing Model, But Introducing 
the fundamental data like Financial Earnings and Interest Rate Decisions will give us a even more accurate a pricing Model.
