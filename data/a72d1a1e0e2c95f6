== AGENT

Children’s National Hospital researchers

== GOAL

To build “a software device to increase access to care and a machine learning technology to identify 
the disease patterns not immediately obvious to the human eye or intuition, and to help physicians 
non-specialized in genetics.”

== DATA

2,8000 retrospective facial photographs of children with and without genetic syndromes from 28 countries, 
including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Morocco, Nigeria, Paraguay, Thailand, and the US.

== METHODS

Supervised deep learning 

== RESULTS

Software that, when given a facial photo of a young child, uses ML to predict potential genetic conditions 

== ISSUES

None

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

Good use of ML to help areas of the world where health care, especially genetic services, is not readily available.
This can close the gap in health disparities and promote more preventitive care.
