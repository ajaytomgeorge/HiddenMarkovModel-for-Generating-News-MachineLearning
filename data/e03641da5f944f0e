==== AGENT

Who did the machine learning?

Chess Robot called Giraffe by Matthew Lai at Imperial College London

==== GOAL

What were they trying to do?

Make a robot teach itself to play chess by evaluating positions much more like
humans and in an entirely different way to conventional chess engines.


==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?

Lai trains his network with a carefully generated set of data taken from real chess games. 
This data set must have the correct distribution of positions

==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

Lai used a bootstrapping technique in which Giraffe played chess against itself
with the goal of improving its own evaluation of a future position.

==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?

Lai tested his machine on a standard database called the Strategic Test Suite, which 
consists of 1,500 positions that are chosen to test an engineâ€™s ability to recognize
different strategic ideas. The maximum score on this test is 15,000. Initially the machine
had a score of 6,000 and after its training for 72 hours it peaked at a score of 9,600 which
matches the best chess engines in the world.

==== COMMENTS

Your own personal comments and thoughts etc.

This is a very interesting article as it shows how far machine learning has come in chess since 
IBMs Deep Blue 20 years ago. Instead of just looking at all the possible combinations of 
moves ahead and choosing the best one, Lai's Giraffe machine plays against itself and teaches 
itself which moves result in strong and weak positions and plays the game more similarly to how 
a human would think but with the same success rate as chess machines.
