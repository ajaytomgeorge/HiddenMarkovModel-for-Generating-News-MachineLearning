== AGENT
AI experts from the autonomous vehicle technology industry.
== GOAL
These experts' goal was to discuss methods of speeding up and spotting flaws in their machine learning systems to account for changes in real 
time.
== DATA
The data used is 6-12 months of driving data, such as potential traffic light scenarios, crash scenarios, etc.
== METHODS
While regressions were mentioned in the article, the type of regression used is never explicitely stated, however I did some research and found 
that Bayesian Regression and Neural Network Regression are among the many machine learning algorithms that can be used in autonomous vehicles. 
Unsupervised Learning models can also be used.
== RESULTS
This article reported on a discussion between AI experts about improving machine learning models in autonomous vehicles, so the results of this 
discussion remain to be seen.
== ISSUES
I don't see any major issues with what was discussed in the article.
== SCORE
6
== COMMENTS
This article gave more of a high-level summary of what was discussed during a meeting between AI experts, so they didn't really mention the 
machine learning algorithms they use in their work in the article.
