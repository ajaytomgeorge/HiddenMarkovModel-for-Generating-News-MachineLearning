== AGENT
Points of entry into Greece

== GOAL

Machine learning algorithm to predict the COVID positivity of travellers and test only those instead of testing all the passengers.

== DATA

Data about incoming passengers — their country and region of origin, 
age and sex — are available digitally, on the passenger locator form that all travellers complete 24 hours before arrival in Greece

== METHODS

Reinforcement learning

== RESULTS
At a given port of entry on a given day, the algorithm delivers targeted recommendations to border agents about which passengers to test, 
while respecting the budget and resource constraints imposed by supply chains, staffing, laboratory capacity and delivery logistics for biological samples.

== ISSUES
Since the results rely on previous batches there could be delay or incorrect prediction due to which a COVID positive passenger may go untested.


== SCORE
9


== COMMENTS
This is a quite impressive innovation. In the time of COVID we have seen huge economic losses everywhere as almost everything was shut down.
People were stuck in many places due to this.Instead of denying all the passengers from a country entering another this will allow the free
movement of COVID negative people.This should have been implemented everywhere.
