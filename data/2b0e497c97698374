== AGENT

Great Learningâ€™s AI & Machine learning PG Programme

== GOAL

Identify Covid-19 in x-rays 

== DATA

Open source data 

== METHODS

Deep convolutional neural network.

== RESULTS

Detects covid with around 95% accuracy

== ISSUES

The work was done using the only 60 x-rays of covid patients in the public domain. More data is needed.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I think it's really interesting that they were able to get seemingly good results from such little data, but I'm also a little skeptical. I'd like to see this done on a larger scale. So much machine learning seems to be doable by individuals or small groups, with the only barrier being access to data. As machine learning becomes more and more mainstream I'd like to see more data in all sorts of fields becoming publically available, allowing people to do work like this.
