==== AGENT
Molecule.one

==== GOAL
To create a platform to simplify the process of turning a molecule existing only in a simulation to a real life
molecule. In simpler terms, once a pharmaceutical comes up with what molecule they want to create, molecule.one provides
the "how".

==== DATA
The ML model has been trained on millions of Patents and known chemical processes.
The data is of type text.  

==== METHODS
The ML model was trained on the data mentioned above, so that it could come up with the a solution for creating a
certain molecule; since it has access to millions of chemical processes.

==== RESULTS
The model works as described; the model has worked for structures that have never been seen before by any chemist. 

==== COMMENTS
There was no info about what type of machine learning algorithm was used.
