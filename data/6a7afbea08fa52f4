== GOAL

identify the right synergistic drug combinations for SARS-CoV-2

== DATA

I assume data was created in a biological lab to train the neural network models on.

== METHODS

Main method was Supervised learning. Neural network to predict interations between pairs of drugs.
Drug-target predictor models the interation between a drug and biological targets of a given disease. Target-disease
association predictor learns to understand a drug's antiviral actibity by observing virus yield in tissue cultures.
These two predictors can in turn predict the synergy of two drugs.

== RESULTS

Two new drug combinations were found to aid in the treatment of covid-19, remdesivir (FDA-approved) and reserpine, as well as remdesivir and IQ-1S.

== ISSUES

I do not see any issues.

== SCORE

9

== COMMENTS

This is by far the most interesting machine learning article I've read. It uses some truly innovative approaches to 
a seemingly infinitely complex problem. The data source remained unspecified, disappointingly enough.
