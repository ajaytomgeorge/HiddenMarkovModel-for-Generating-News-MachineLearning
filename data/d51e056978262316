== AGENT

Researchers at GlaxoSmithKline and the Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Centre carried out this work

== GOAL

Their goal was to use advanced machine learning methods to predict 
stable polymorphs to use in new drugs

== DATA

Using CCDC software they select a portion of the most admissible entries 
that is large enough to give conidence, the GSK will eventually going to have
highly relevant elements to other compounds in their comercial portfolio.
So this makes it possible for the model building software to use. 

== METHODS

It was said that if the CSD software picked around two thousand structures
from the 1.1 million in the CSD, you would be able to pick around 40 or 50
highly relevant structures, but this data would be insufficient to build a
good model with that alone.

So they said that by including the GSK and CSD sets its better on both sides
as all the highly relevant industrial structures and the relevant CSD structures
together to build a better performing and higher quality model.

== RESULTS

It was said that the more data they had the more confident predictions they
obtained and that data that were directly relevant to the problem lead to more 
precise and accurate predictions.

== ISSUES

It was said that the different packaging methods meant that one polymorph might
be more suited for the therapeutic delivery and another from the same compound might 
not.

== SCORE

3

== COMMENTS

I thought this article was okay, there was nothing really interesting going on and 
it seemd like there was nothing really clear about the situation.It doesn't do a 
giving results and methods of how the researcher are going about their work and the 
title seems a lot like clickbait.
