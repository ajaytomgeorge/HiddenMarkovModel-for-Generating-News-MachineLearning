AGENT

CMR Surgical
CMR Surgical is a private limited company registered in England No. 08863657.

GOAL

Versius has been built to assist with robotic surgery. The idea behind Versius was to use robotics to give surgeons a superior tool for providing minimal access surgery, so that many more patients will be able to benefit from it.

DATA

Sequence of symptoms
Patient records
Historical diagnoses and Clincal Records
Surgeon's Input in the console.

METHODS

A robot arm with a seventh degree of freedom by adding extra joints in the arm and the wrist to mimic exactly the human arm after careful study of existing approaches used in clinical surgeries is developed.
It is not only about opening access to keyhole surgery, but by storing data after each operation, the system will also enable surgeons to refine their technique. 
The information recorded by the robot about how it has been used can be analysed, compared and fed back to surgeons.


RESULTS

Versius has been built to assist with robotic surgery and is a competitor of the American system, da Vinci. 
Currently, da Vinci is used in more than 70 UK hospitals. However, Versius offers the advantage of being smaller, more versatile and flexible. 
Furthermore, the modular arms are quick and easy to set up. This means it can be used in more operations and help to drive cost-saving and increase productivity across hospitals

COMMENTS

Although the Versius robotic surgical system is as popular as the Da Vinci surgical system, it has to overcome latency and performance issues and also it is available only in Europe and not world-wide.
