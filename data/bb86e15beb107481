==== AGENT

Who did the machine learning? (E.g., Google Brain, Prof Jane Baz’s group
at University of North Hoople, etc.)

==== GOAL

Create a machine learning model that would predict he cognitive decline of patients
at risk for Alzheimer’s disease by forecasting their cognition test scores up to 
two years in the future, which could help zero in on the right patients to 
select for clinical trials.

==== DATA

The dataset contains data from around 1,700 participants, with and without 
Alzheimer’s, recorded during semiannual doctor’s visits over 10 years.

==== METHODS
Data was use to train a population model powered by a “nonparametric” probability framework, 
called Gaussian Processes (GPs), which has flexible parameters to fit various probability distributions and to process uncertainties in data. 
This technique measures similarities between variables, such as patient data points, to predict a value for an unseen data point — such as
a cognitive score. The output also contains an estimate for how certain it is about the prediction. The model works robustly even when analyzing 
datasets with missing values or lots of noise from different data-collecting 
formats.

==== RESULTS

The machine learning model has been very successful and so the researchers are hoping to partner with pharmaceutical 
firms to implement the model into real-world Alzheimer’s clinical trials.
