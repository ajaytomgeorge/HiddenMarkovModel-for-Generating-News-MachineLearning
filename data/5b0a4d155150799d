==== GOAL

To teach an AI how to model movement of animals and humans by Reinforcement Learning.

==== DATA

Videos of the specific animal walking and trial and error with the learning.

==== METHODS

Use Reinforcement Learning by providing some benefit or motive to the AI in trying to 
learn complex movement patterns such as jumping, crouching to pass obstacles. Then it is simply
trial and error till they manage to achieve the pre defined goals.

==== RESULTS

Although not yet complete, the research is promising with AI learning to perform some motor 
functions although it is quite unrefined as of now. 

==== COMMENTS

Could have more use in making video games or pperhaps for robots in future.
