Develped by Illia Ziamtsov and Saket Navlakha at Salk's Integrative Biology Laboratory.

==== GOAL

To tackle three primary challenges in plant phenotyping: lamina/stem classification, lamina counting, and stem skeletonization.

==== DATA

For classification, they used a dataset of 54 3D shoot architectures.
Then, they inputted the resulting 3D point clouds into machine-learning algorithms. 
  
==== METHODS

For classification, they used object detection.
For lamina counting, they developed an enhanced region-growing algorithm to reduce oversegmentation.
For stem skeletonization,  they developed an enhanced tip detection technique.

==== RESULTS

For classification, they classified lamina versus stems with 97.8% accuracy.
For lamina counting, they achieved 86.6% accuracy, outperforming prior methods developed for this problem
For stem skeletonization, they generated more precise skeleton architectures than prior methods.

Interesting they used 3D point clouds as their dataset. Shows the versatility and applicability of ML.
