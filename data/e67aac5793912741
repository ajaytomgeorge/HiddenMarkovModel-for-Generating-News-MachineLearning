== AGENT

Researchers at Stanford University

== GOAL

To create as interface where paralyzed patients can write by using their brain waves.

== DATA

The data came from a study of a long-term clinical trial called BrainGate2 in which participants who are paralyzed have sensors implanted in the motor cortex of their brains and work with researchers who aim to use the sensor's data to develop Brain Computer Interface. 

== METHODS

They used the signals generated by the brain and the computer converts it into the possible letters or digits.

== RESULTS

They created a brain-implant system trained to decode the neural signals for handwriting from a paralyzed man enabled a computer to type up to 90 characters per minute with 94 percent accuracy.

== ISSUES

None

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

It would be nice if paralyzed patients can express their true feelings atleast on paper if they don't want to talk with someone or tell it aloud to everyone.
