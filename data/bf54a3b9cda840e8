Researchers at the MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub

== GOAL

See if innovative planning strategies could improve pavement environmental and performance outcomes

== DATA

Segments of an entire pavement network - Iowa U.S Route network

== METHODS

Suervised Learning Model - Probabilistic Treatment Path Dependence. Thousands of simulations
run on pavement damage prediction; treatment cost prediction; budget allocation; and pavement 
network condition evaluation.

== RESULTS

Generating a model for construction and road management. Using the model, if their approach was used, 
it is estimated that "pavement-related greenhouse gas emissions would fall by around 20 percent across 
the network over the whole period." Efficiency for cars also improved. Using current strategies, a 32 percent greater
budget would be needed to achieve the same effects. 

== ISSUES

None with approach, but input data seemed to be only from Iowa. Could outside factors unique to Iowa improve or 
detriment model (weather, companies, drivers, etc) 

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

I think using ML to try and improve emissions and improve infastructure is a great idea, but should not be an excuse
to limit spending on infastructure since MIT's method is more efficient with lest spending.
