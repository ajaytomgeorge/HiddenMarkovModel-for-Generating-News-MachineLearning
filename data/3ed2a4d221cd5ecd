== GOAL
Detecting Fake News using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms

== DATA
It is dealing with text data by Count Vectors, TF-IDF, Character Level

== METHODS

The classification models that we implemented using above mentioned dataset are Bayesian Model, Logistic Regression & also Support Vector Machine two most famous deep learning methods RNN Recurrent Neural Network & Long Short-Term Memory were also implemented to see how well our data fit into the model.

== RESULTS
It gives 73% accuracy on count vector feature, 75% on Word Level TF-IDF, N - gram vector, and character vector as well. Then Logistic regression model was performed. This time the performance was slightly optimized than before, predicting 74% and 76% respectively on count and word level vectors. Whereas 75% and 76% was the results of Logistic Regression stage.

== ISSUES

Inter Accuracy Prediction is isnt better.

== SCORE
6

== COMMENTS
In this they have analyzed a computerized model for checking the verification of news extracted from Twitter which gives general answers for information accumulation and expository demonstration towards fake news recognition.
