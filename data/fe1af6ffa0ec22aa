Other places like banks, hospital, educational institutes and more are using these systems to check that the proper 
procedures are being followed by staff and clients

if the system is being used alongside a human it may not be used properly and could end up missing certain cases that
could have fraud

== SCORE

== COMMENTS

This system is being used for fraud identification. The report doesn't go into much information of the type of
network that was used and the data used to train the network. It does go into info on how the network could be used 
for fraud detection and how it could be improved.
