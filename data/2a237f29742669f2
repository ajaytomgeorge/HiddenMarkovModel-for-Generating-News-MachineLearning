==== GOAL

He was attempting to create a Neural Network that when shown a GUI
for an app could generate a Layout code from that screenshot.

==== DATA

Screenshots of GUI for ios that they wrote original code for. This way they
could check if the results were accurate.

==== METHODS

They used a trained deep Neural Network that had been thought the language used for
this research. They then used screenshots from web applications/GUI for ios as their input
and the NN would generate source code and output its own version of that GUI.

==== RESULTS

They claimed to be able to achieve results with 77% accuracy. However it is still under
research and no application discussed yet.

==== COMMENTS

This technology could have applications in the area of education. For eample if we knew
how this code learned new languages/interpreted the screenshots it could potentially aid
universities or schools when trying to teach computer science to their students.
