== AGENT
Penn State Researchers and Archaeologists.
== GOAL
To train and use a machine learning algorithm that can identify archaeological structures (shells, as mentioned in the article).
== DATA
Lidar of some terrain and Synthetic Aperture Data.
== METHODS
Supervised Learning (Deep Learning).
== RESULTS
The algorithm was used to discover shells rings and mounds left by indigenous people approximately 3,000-5,000 years ago, once the model was 
trained with this data.
== ISSUES
This article was slightly sparce on detail in regard to the machine learning method.
== SCORE
7
== COMMENTS
This algorithm is interesting as it can be trained to identify shapes other than shell rings, which should be extremely useful in the area of 
airborne archaeological exploration.
