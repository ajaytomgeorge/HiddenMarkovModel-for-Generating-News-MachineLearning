== AGENT

TensorFlow, Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) laboratory, UC Berkeley

== GOAL

Given any two unordered image collections X and Y, the algorithm learns to automatically "translate" an image from one into the other and vice versa

== DATA

Images of Horses-Zebras, Monet paintings and Landscape photos, collection of paintings of famous artists

== METHODS

The algorithm used is Cycle-GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)

== ISSUES

Limitation when exploring geometric changes (for example dog -> cat)

== SCORE
