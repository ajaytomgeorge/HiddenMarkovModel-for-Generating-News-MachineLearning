GOAL : The goal was to use Machine Learning for Genetic Research that will show the working of the cells and also will help to develop new drugs for COVID 19 and other diseases. 

Data, Method and Results : The researchers combined a machine learning algorithm with knowledge known from hundreds of biological experiments to develop a technique that will allow biomedical researchers to figure out the turn genes on and off in cells. This will help in developing drugs for many diseases. A widely known machine learning tool, the Seurat analysis platform, has helped process data from single cell RNA and help in developing drugs.  This approach works across a broad range of cell types and organs that could be developed for treatment of many difficult to treat diseases. 


SCORE : 9


COMMENTS : I think this is one of the perfect use of the tool Seurat analysis platform. With the use of Machine Learning, drugs can be developed for many hard to treat diseases. The article gives us the chance to know the mechanism of the entire research and also gives us very detailed information on biological aspect of the research.
