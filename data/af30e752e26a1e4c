==== AGENT

Google AI 

==== GOAL

What were they trying to do?
The goal of Google AI (trained with Machine Learning), is to identify breast cancer more accurately than radiologists. About 1 in 8 women in the U.S. will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. This type of research is very important in reducing the growth of breast cancer in a cancer victim.

==== DATA

Where did they get their data? 
The data was acquired by using digital mammograms (X-ray images) from 76,000 women in the U.K. and more than 15,000 women in the U.S (According to Google Health).

What did it look like?
The results of the data "exceeded expectations" and gave an option to reduce human workload by using the Google AI model.

==== METHODS

What did they actually do?
The researchers fed the data through a model around 100 thousand times. This model then improved itself over the iterations. It also uses less data than a radiologists would require to detect breast cancer, the AI only requires the anonymized mammogram and provides a better accuracy in spotting breast cancer.

==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?
The results were impressive to them, it produced 1.2% reduction in the UK and 5.7% reduction in the US. It was able to reduce the false negatives by 2.7% in the UK and 9.4% in the US. This improvement in accuracy is crucial in the next steps of technology and AI, allowing us to help many more people and saving a lot of effort from our radiologists.

Include things about the deficiency of the story as written if youâ€™re feeling snarky.

I feel like this article is really interesting, something I would love to do if I took a machine learning and AI path. It allows us to progress in our medical technologies and helps us prevent cancer easier than ever. Could you imagine walking into a booth in a shopping center and it could provide a cancer reading for you? Although we are not quite there yet, this type of technology is the future.
