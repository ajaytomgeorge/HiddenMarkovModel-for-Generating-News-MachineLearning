==== AGENT

Who did the machine learning? 

Google Maps

==== GOAL

What were they trying to do?

Use machine learning to incorperate the length of time it takes to find a parking 
space at a destination into a persons estimated time of arrival. 

==== DATA

Where did they get their data? What did it look like?

Researchers at Google studied the historical parking data and collected infromation from over 100K people 
by asking questions such as "How long did it take you to find parking?"
They also used anonymous information from users who had chosen to share their location data to create
training models. For example, if a person keeps circling or walking around 
after reaching the intended destination, it could mean finding a parking spot there is difficult.


==== METHODS

What did they actually do?

They used standard logistic regression model on the gathered information for machine learning to 
leverage the features based on the dispersion of parking locations and predict how difficult 
finding an empty spot would be at any given time in a particular place. 


==== RESULTS

How did it go for them?

Google has now released this feature on android in over 50 cities worldwide, 25 of which are in the
USA. This is working very successfully and provides a useful piece of information to people travelling 
in big cities.

==== COMMENTS

Your own personal comments and thoughts etc.

This is a misleading feature for Google Maps as when you first read the title you think they will be 
predicting parking spots that are available and can direct you to one but it is only using machine
learning to estimate how long it will take to find a parking spot at a particular time in a city, with a 
bit of local knowledge you would know this information anyways so it really is just a feature for the sake
of adding in an extra feature.
