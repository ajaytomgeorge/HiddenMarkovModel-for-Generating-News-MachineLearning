== AGENT

AI Researchers at Electronic Arts (EA)

== GOAL

To test and show that Adversarial Reinforcement Learning agents can be used to test large, procedurally generated levels in video games.

== DATA

The data used in this paper was generated by the research team. The paper focused on 'procedural generation' of possible game levels which were created by the Generator as part of the machine learning and the results came from the Solver attempting to complete these levels.

== METHODS

The method used was Adversarial Reinforcement Learning. A Generator created levels for a Solver to attempt to complete and they were trained with/against each other.

== RESULTS

The results were very positive.
The Generator was successful in learning to create a path towards a randomly generated goal.
The Solver was key to this, as without the Solver, the Generator converged towards impossible environments due to non-adaptive solving agents being easily exploited.

This all means ARLPCG is positive new approach to Procedural Generation and testing.

== ISSUES

I think one issue with this is the difficulty of reproduction. The research team used a lot of 'procedural generation' that is common in video games but it may be difficult to recreate their procedural generation system, especially given that there is no official code available with the paper.

== SCORE

7

== COMMENTS

The press covered this well. They included explanations for why the research was done, as well as what the results meant.
They also explained reinforcement learning well, and how it related to the topic.

The research team didn't provide details on the architecture used for the reinforcement learning, and didn't provide code to reproduce the system. I think this should have been done and hope to see this improved in future.
