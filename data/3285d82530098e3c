==== GOAL

The researchers were trying to train a two legged robot to navigate an uneven ground surface
such as a rotating platform.

==== DATA

The biped robot had supervised learning and reinforcement learning in order to train it to remain
standing on the rotating platform. 

==== METHODS

When it fell over it was told that was wrong and when it remained
standing it was told it was correct. Eventually the robot learning to maintain its posture.

==== RESULTS

The robot can maintain its standing posture perfectly and adapt to the rotating  
platform with various oscillations.

==== COMMENTS

This technology can be used for many applications including humanoid robots 
in fields such as healthcare, education, disaster response and entertainment.
