== GOAL

obtain a highly accurate prediction model of material properties from uncontrollable descriptors with as few experiments as possible.

== DATA

75 types of polypropylene data

== METHODS

Bayesian optimization and uncertainty sampling

== RESULTS

Only worked on materials with an accurate model

== ISSUES

I don't know enough about the subject to say

== SCORE

2

== COMMENTS

the results stated that a good result can be gained when the model is accurate, this
seems pretty obvious but I'm likely not getting something.
